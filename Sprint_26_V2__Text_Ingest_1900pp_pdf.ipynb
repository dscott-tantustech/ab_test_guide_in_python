cancer \\n(chemotherapy and CAR-T cell therapy); (2) proposing to allow payment for dental \\nexaminations, diagnostic, and treatment services prior to and during antiresorptive and/or

from p. 1220: [If we were to finalize the proposal that Medicare Part A and Part B payment can be made \\nfor oral or dental examination, and necessary treatment, performed prior to and during certain \\ncancer treatments or drug therapies associated with managing cancer related care, we do not \\nanticipate any significant increase in utilization or payment impact for additional dental services \\ngiven the historically low utilization of these therapies.] from p. 1220: [Although, we acknowledge that the \\nobserved utilization of these services might have been low because of the size of the population \\nof patients whose treatment would include such dental services and also because the dental \\nservices have been viewed as subject to the payment preclusion under section 1862(a)(12).]

dental] from p. 1221: [services for which services Medicare could pay in CY 2024, if these proposals are finalized.] from p. 1221: [The \\nestimated average cost for these additional dental services

limited claims involving these services.] from p. 1221: [Based on this same analysis, the effective rate of coverage was less than 0.2 percent.] from p. 1221: [We do \\nacknowledge that the actual take-up rate of services could be higher due to the proposed \\nadditional examples of medical services to which dental services are inextricably linked, which \\nmay raise awareness that payment is available.] from p. 1221: [Therefore, we prepared impact estimates under \\nthe utilization assumptions of 0.2 percent and between 1-3 percent.] from p. 1221: [We then applied these \\nutilization ratios to estimate projected payments for dental exams and treatments in connection \\nwith cancer therapies.] from p. 1221: [We found that the estimated yearly impact beginning in CY 2024 to be

revised E/M visit code sets in the context of the generally \\nrecognized need to better recognize resources involved in furnishing different types of services \\nwithin the broader PFS.] from p. 1222: [While we adopted the RUC-recommended values for the O/O E/M visit \\ncode family in the CY 2021 final rule, recognizing that those values generally reflect the \\nresources involved in furnishing those services, we did not believe those valuations appropriately \\nreflected the resource costs involved in furnishing primary and other similarly longitudinal \\nmedical care for a serious or complex condition in office settings.] from p. 1222: [To address this concern, \\neffective beginning in CY 2021, we finalized an add-on code to separately pay for visit \\ncomplexity inherent to O/O E/M visits for primary care and other medical care services that are \\npart of ongoing care related to a patient's single, serious, or complex condition in the office \\nsetting (the O/O E/M visit inherent complexity add-on).] from p. 1222: [After we finalized the CY 2021 \\npayment changes for O/O E/M visits, in the CAA of 2021, Congress imposed a statutory \\nmoratorium on Medicare payment for the O/O E/M visit inherent complexity add-on code until \\nJanuary 1, 2024.] from p. 1222: [We propose to implement payment for the O/O E/M visit inherent complexity add-on, \\nHCPCS code G2211, with significant refinements to target improved payment for primary and \\nother similar longitudinal care for serious or complex conditions.] from p. 1222: [Specifically, we are proposing \\nthat the O/O E/M visit complexity add-on code cannot be billed with visits reported using] from p. 1223: [Modifier 25 which is used to indicate that the service is billed on the same day as a minor \\nprocedure or another E/M visit.] from p. 1223: [(Previously, in the CY 2021 final rule, we stated we would not \\nexpect such billing; but as there was no explicit prohibition, these visits were included in the \\nbudget neutrality adjustment (85 FR 84572)).] from p. 1223: [We also propose to set PFS rates with a refined, \\nmore specific utilization assumption that better recognizes likely uptake of the code, differential \\nuse among specialties, and new and established patient visits, among other changes.] from p. 1223: [These \\nrefined assumptions were developed, taking into consideration perspectives and information \\nprovided by interested parties.] from p. 1223: [The resulting estimate reflects that the O/O E/M visit inherent \\ncomplexity add-on code would likely be reported with approximately 38 percent of all O/O E/M \\nvisits for CY 2024.] from p. 1223: [As discussed previously and shown below, we estimate the specific portion \\nof the total budget neutrality adjustment attributable to the proposal to make payment for the \\nO/O E/M inherent complexity add-on code to be approximately 2.00 percent compared to an \\nattributable budget

        "In the Proposed Rule, CMS included five questions related to the AMA PPI Survey:\n",
        "\n",
        "a.\tIf CMS should consider aggregating data for certain physician specialties to generate indirect allocators so that PE/HR calculations based on PPI survey data would be less likely to over- allocate (or under-allocate) indirect PE to a given set of services, specialties, or practice types. Further, what thresholds or methodological approaches could be employed to establish such aggregations?\n",
        "The AMA PPI survey uses stratification to control the distribution of sampled cases, either to match the distribution of the population or to differ from it in a controlled way. The use of stratification will improve the precision of estimates, both overall and within subgroups defined by the stratification. The AMA recommends that CMS postpone any consideration of the level of granularity of specialty-level data until after the PPI demonstrates the differences and similarities of practice costs by specialty. The AMA and Mathematica could consider recommendations related to this question once the study is completed.\n",
        "\n",
        "b.\tWhether aggregations of services, for purposes of assigning PE inputs, represent a fair, stable, and accurate means to account for indirect PE across various specialties or practice types?\n",
        "The AMA believes that it is important for the CMS practice expense methodology to have a sufficient level of granularity to reflect actual practice costs incurred by physician practices. Ambulatory payment classification (APC) codes from the OPPS, for example, would not represent a fair, stable, and accurate means to account for indirect practice expense for the MFS due to lack of granularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Resource costs in the MFS are developed through an extremely granular “bottom-up” methodology in which the necessary resource costs are added line-by-line to achieve the actual costs for the physician to provide the care. In contrast, payment to facilities under the OPPS is calculated on the geometric mean of the costs of services in the same APC codes. To equate the rigorously developed line-item costs associated with services performed in the non-facility setting, with charges that are intended to be an average of “similar” services when performed in the facility is severely flawed because the two systems are making payments under vastly different assumptions.\n",
        "While hospital charge information is updated on a rolling basis, it does not mean that these cost data are more accurate. Under the OPPS, each APC is assigned a cost weight based on the geometric mean costs of all the procedures assigned to that APC. These estimated costs are derived from hospital charges adjusted to costs using each hospital’s cost to charge ratio (CCR). Rather than estimating the costs of each resource on a per line-item basis, this ratio is an average at the hospital department level. Since the creation of the OPPS, this averaging mechanism has consistently resulted in charge compression. CMS defines charge compression as the “practice of applying a lower charge markup to higher cost services and a higher charge markup to lower cost services.” As a result, the cost-based weights may reflect some aggregation bias, undervaluing high-cost items and overvaluing low-cost items when an estimate of average markup, embodied in a single CCR, is applied to items of widely varying costs in the same cost center.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For the over 8,000 CPT/Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes that have “Active” or “Restricted Coverage” status the CY2024 MFS NPRM Addendum B, there are only 162 unique APC codes in the CY2024 OPPS NPRM addendum B. Over 3,000 of the CPT/HCPCS codes that are “Active” or have “Restricted Coverage” status do not even have an assigned APC code.\n",
        "\n",
        "c.\tIf and how CMS should balance factors that influence indirect PE inputs when these factors are likely driven by a difference in geographic location or setting of care, specific to individual practitioners (or practitioner types) versus other specialty/practice specific characteristics (for example, practice size, patient population served)?\n",
        "In the PPI study, the AMA and Mathematica are controlling the number of sampled practices within strata defined by (1) specialty, (2) proportion of time in the facility setting, (3) practice size, (4) ownership type (individual ownership vs. more complex ownership types), (5) geographic region, and among practices with complex ownership, whether (6) the practice is part of a vertically integrated health system, and (7) private equity ownership.\n",
        "\n",
        "The AMA and Mathematica are using these criteria for our Initial sampling, and if there is variance in the response rates between different practice types, we will also use these criteria to adjust the sampling midway through the data collection period. Finally, the AMA and Mathematica will develop final analysis weights to adjust for the probability of selection, practice eligibility, and cooperation, ensuring selected weighted totals match marginal population totals from the sample frame. In the survey itself, participating practices are asked to split out their provider compensation and time, staffing and other direct and indirect practice expenses at the Medicare specialty level, if possible.\n",
        "The AMA and Mathematica could provide recommendations related to this question once the PPI survey is completed. The PPI sampling and weighting methodology should account for most of these factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "d.\tWhat possible unintended consequences may result if CMS were to act upon the respondents’ recommendations for any of highlighted considerations above?\n",
        "Medicare payment differentials between the MFS and the OPPS are significant and have been growing, and this may be a factor in the decline in private practice. In fact, physician survey data indicate that payment and practice costs are two of the three leading reasons for private practices selling to hospitals or health systems.3 It is important to ensure that any potential changes to CMS practice expense methodology do not further exacerbate this relationship and instead work towards correcting site of service inconsistencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "In last year’s NPRM, CMS provided an impact table related to the initiative of rebasing and revising the MEI weights. CMS noted that implementation of that change in the PE methodology would have shifted payment weights from physician work to practice expense principally favoring Diagnostic Testing Facility (+13 percent), Portable X-Ray Supplier (+13 percent), Independent Laboratory (+10 percent), and Radiation Therapy Centers (+6 percent) to the detriment of Cardiothoracic Surgery (-8 percent), Neurosurgery (-8 percent), Emergency Medicine (-8 percent), and Anesthesiology (-5 percent). Modest increases occur to specialties who provide services in the office with extremely expensive disposable supplies embedded into physician payment.

Similar to that separate policy change, other changes to the PE methodology would cause massive shifts between specialties, as well as within specialties, and put the solvency of many physician practices and other health care organizations in jeopardy. Any changes that are considered should be made carefully to ensure they reflect actual practice costs incurred by physician practices.

It outlines the transition from the previous locality structure to a new one based on Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) as of December 31 of the previous year, increasing the number of fee schedule areas from 9 to 32. This change aimed to more accurately reflect the cost differences within California. During this transition, certain areas were subject to a phased adjustment of GPCI values, blending old and new locality structures over six years, concluding in 2022. However, a \"hold harmless\" requirement ensures that GPCI values for these areas do not fall below what they would have been under the old structure, which continues to be in effect without a specified end date.\n",

The \"Regulations Proposal\" seeks comments on policies related to dental services for which Medicare payment can be made (p. 346). It mentions that Medicare payment is generally precluded for dental services under section 1862(a)(12) of the Act, except when hospitalization is required due to the patient’s medical condition or the severity of the dental procedure (p. 309). However, there are clinical scenarios where dental services are inextricably linked to a primary medical service covered by Medicare, allowing for payment (p. 318, 319, 341). Examples include treatments associated with cancer, cardiovascular procedures, diabetes treatment, and systemic autoimmune diseases (p. 315). The proposal suggests that for dental services to be covered, there must be coordination between professionals providing the dental and covered services (p. 348). The impact of these proposals on utilization or payment is not expected to be significant (p. 1220).</p>\n",

The   2024   Medicare   conversion   factor   is   proposed   to   be   reduced   by   3.36   percent   from   $33.8872   to $32.7476.   Similarly,   the   anesthesia   conversion   factor   is   proposed   to   be   reduced   from   $21.1249   to $20.4370. These cuts result from a -1.25 percent reduction in the temporary update to the conversion factor under current law and a negative budget neutrality adjustment stemming in large part from the adoption   of   an   office   visit   add-on   code,   discussed   below.   Unfortunately,   these   cuts   coincide   with   ongoing growth in the cost to practice medicine as CMS projects the increase in the MEI for 2024 will be 4.5  percent. Physician practices cannot continue to absorb increasing costs while their payment rates dwindle. We already know how that story ends, and it is not a happy ending. According to the  , if physician   payment   does   not   change,   access   to   Medicare-participating   physicians   will   become   a   significant issue in the long term. Some Medicare patients are already experiencing inequitable delays in care, and   we know that when care is delayed, health outcomes worsen. These problems particularly impact minoritized and marginalized patients  and those who live in rural areas.  Will patients with Medicare have to wait six months to see a neurologist when they can no longer remember what day of the week it is? Will they have to wait eight months for an appointment with an oncologist about a persistent lump? Will they forego an endoscopy or mammography because the nearest gastroenterologist or radiologist who   accepts   Medicare   is   more   than   an   hour   away?   We   are   urging   both   Congress   and   CMS   to   intervene before these problems get any worse. We appreciate that in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, Congress partially mitigated a 4.5 percent cut to Medicare physician payment rates, but physicians still endured a two percent pay cut this year   and   for   2024,   physicians   are   facing   another   1.25   percent   cut,   once   again   confronting   the   grim   task   of reconciling how to keep their lights on while getting paid less, while their expenses continue to rise. In fact, between 2001 and 2023, the cost of running a medical practice increased 47 percent, or 1.8 percent per year. In striking contrast, physician payment rates have    just nine percent over the last 22 years, or 0.4 percent per year, according to data from the Medicare Trustees. Adjusted for inflation, Medicare physician payment rates declined 26 percent from 2001 to 2023, or by 1.3 percent per year. Hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and nearly every other Medicare provider receive an annual update. Physicians compete in the same marketplaces as these providers for clinical and administrative staff, equipment, and supplies. Yet physicians are at a significant disadvantage due to payment cuts and because   their   payments   have   failed   to   keep   up   with   inflation.   It   is   no   wonder   that   these   trends   are   driving consolidation, which is highly likely to increase future Medicare costs as these other providers receive increasingly higher payments than the diminishing number of independent medical practices. This Administration has    that   health   care consolidation   is   leaving   many areas, particularly rural communities, with inadequate or more expensive health care options. A new AMA analysis shows that by far, the most cited reason that independent physicians sell their practices   to   hospitals   or   health   systems   had   to   do   with   inadequate   payment.   Next   were   the   need   to   better manage payers\\u2019 regulatory and administrative requirements and the need to improve access to costly resources. Included below is an excerpted figure with more detail. The AMA strongly supports policies that promote market competition and patient choice. Payment adequacy is necessary for physicians to continue to have the ability to practice independently.  1   See e.g.,  Johnston KJ, Hammond G, Meyers DJ, Joynt Maddox KE.

JAMA.   2021;326(7):628\\u2013636.  doi:10.1001/jama.2021.10413 2    Earlier this year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission ( MedPAC ) recommended that Congress increase   2024   Medicare   physician   payments   above   current   law   by   linking   the   payment update   to   the   MEI, something the AMA and organized medicine have long    MedPAC  raised concerns about the growing gap between what it costs to run a medical practice and what Medicare pays.  While we recognize that CMS does not have the authority to provide an inflation-based update for physicians, we strongly urge the agency to use every policy lever available to reduce the proposed budget neutrality reduction for physician services in 2024 and to close the gap between the Medicare physician payment update and the rising cost of practicing medicine, which is estimated to increase by 4.5 percent next year. As discussed below, we believe CMS should lower the utilization estimate for the office visit add-on code, which would lower the budget neutrality cut to the conversion factor. The   AMA   and   organized   medicine   are   also   pursuing   legislative   relief   from   the   unsustainable   trajectory   of Medicare physician payment. Specifically, we    H.R. 2474, the \\u201cStrengthening Medicare for Patients and Providers Act,\\u201d which provides a permanent annual update equal to the increase in the MEI. Such an update would allow physicians to invest in their practices and implement new strategies to provide high-value, patient-centered care.   We hope the agency   will work with the   AMA and Congress to seek   this   legislative   relief.   This   would   enable   CMS   to   prioritize   advancing   high-quality   care   for Medicare beneficiaries without the constant specter of market consolidation or inadequate access to care. These concerns stem from the disparity between Medicare physician payment rates and the actual costs associated with delivering high-quality care.\",\n          \"The AMA appreciates CMS for accepting the RUC/HCPAC values as recommended for Caregiver Training Services, a series of three new CPT codes established to capture functional caregiver training services   provided   to   caregivers   without   the   patient   present.   These   new   codes   will   enhance   communication between therapy practitioners, physicians, and caregivers, and reduce risk of patient injury and increase patient outcomes. CMS coverage of these services acknowledges the importance of caregiver training to alleviate the significant burden that falls greatest on caregivers in lower socioeconomic groups and diverse populations and supports both CMS and HHS initiatives on diversity, equity, and inclusion for family caregivers.\",\n          \"Determination   of   Practice   Expense   (PE)   Relative   Value   Units   (RVUs)  Recommendation: The AMA strongly supports the CMS proposal to postpone implementation of new MEI relative value   weights.   The   AMA   is   engaged   in   a   significant effort   to   collect practice   costs   data   and   urges CMS to continue to base MEI weights on AMA data sources. MEI   and   the   Physician   Practice   Information   (PPI)  Survey The MEI, first implemented in 1975, has long served as a measure of practice cost inflation and a mechanism   to   determine   the   proportion   of   payments   attributed   to   physician   earnings   and   practice   costs.   In the nearly 50 years since the initial establishment of the MEI, data collected by the AMA has served as   the standard and a consistent source of information about physicians\\u2019 earnings and practice costs. The MEI weights that are the basis for current CMS   rate setting were based on data obtained   from the AMA\\u2019s PPI Survey. This survey was last conducted in 2007/2008 and collected 2006 data. In last year\\u2019s Final Rule, CMS finalized updated MEI weights for the different cost components of the MEI   for CY   2023   using   a   new   methodology   based   primarily   on   a   subset   of data   from   the   2017   US   Census Bureau\\u2019s Service Annual Survey (SAS). However, CMS also noted that they postponed implementation   of   the   proposed   MEI   changes   until   time   uncertain,   referencing   the   need   for   continued   public   comment   due to the significant impact to physician payments. MEI  History In the CY 2024 Proposed Rule, CMS announced that they will continue to postpone implementation of the updated MEI weights, referencing the AMA\\u2019s national study to collect representative data on physician   practice   expenses,   the   AMA   PPI   Survey.   The   AMA   applauds   CMS   for   recognizing   the   PPI Survey effort and postponing implementation of the updated MEI relative value weights. \\u201cIn light of the AMA\\u2019s intended data   collection efforts   in the near   future   and because the methodological and data source changes to the MEI finalized in the CY 2023 PFS Final Rule would have significant impacts   on   PFS   payments,   we   continue   to   believe   that   delaying   the   implementation   of the   finalized   2017- based MEI cost weights for the RVUs is consistent with our efforts to balance payment stability and predictability   with   incorporating   new   data   through   more   routine   updates.   Therefore,   we   are   not   proposing to incorporate the 2017-based MEI in PFS [rate setting] for CY 2024.\\u201d The AMA and Mathematica formally launched the PPI Survey on July 31, 2023.   supported   by     will   provide   more   than   10,000   physician   practices   with   the opportunity   to   share   their   practice   cost   data   and   number   of   direct   patient   care   hours   provided   by   both physicians and qualified health care professionals. A   coalition   of   other   non-MD/DO   organizations   is   also   working   with   Mathematica   to   administer   a   similar study of their respective professions. These physician and qualified health care professional (QHP) surveys will be in the field through April 2024. Data would be shared with CMS in early 2025 for the 2026 MFS rulemaking process. Major   Flaw   with   Updated   MEI   Weight   Methodology CMS   used   data from the US   Census Bureau\\u2019s Service   Annual Survey   (SAS)   as   the primary   source   for   the proposed   MEI   cost-component   weights.   The   changes   lead   to   substantial   increases   in   the   weights   for   many of the key components of physician practice expense and would greatly reduce the MEI weights for physician work and professional liability insurance. If   the   implementation   of   the   MEI   weights   is   budget   neutral,   overall   physician   work   payment   would   be   cut by 7 percent and practice liability insurance (PLI) payment would be reduced severalfold. The weight of non-physician   compensation   would   increase   from 16.6   percent   to   24.7   percent under the   new   MEI.   These large shifts are principally due to a substantial error in CMS analysis, which omitted nearly 200,000 facility-based   physicians.   After   correcting   for   this   major   omission,   the   physician   work   MEI   weight   would instead increase and PLI would likely experience a much smaller reduction. CMS relied on US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS)   data   to   split   out   the   US   Census   SAS   data   using   only   the   \\u201cOffices   of   Physicians\\u201d   North   American Industry Classification System (NAICS) category 6211. However, only 64 percent of employed physicians are in this category. CMS-updated MEI erroneously excluded 36 percent of physicians who   are employed in other health care settings, such as hospitals. For example, the \\u201cGeneral Medical and Surgical Hospitals\\u201d category (NAICS 6221) was not included in the CMS analysis and this category includes 158,880 employed physicians according to the 2017 BLS OEWS data. In the CY2023   MFS Final   Rule,   in responses   to   the AMA and RUC pointing out   this omission of data in the CMS analysis, CMS responded that \\u201cfor physicians who are employed in other health care settings directly, such as hospitals, we do not believe that including costs for physicians that do not incur any operating expenses associated with running a practice would be technically appropriate.\\u201d However, this fails to consider that the MEI weights also cover physician compensation and professional liability insurance.   By   excluding   NAICS   6221   General   Medical   and   Surgical   Hospitals   in   the   CMS   MEI   weights analysis, CMS inadvertently omitted over $30 billion in physician compensation and over $7 billion in professional liability insurance compensation. Also, physician practices do still have some indirect practice   expense   costs   even   for providers   who   are   solely   facility-based   (coding,   billing,   scheduling,   etc.). The CMS   analysis of   the   US   Census SAS   data captured a large   majority of practice expense   covered by the   MFS   but   only   a   subset   of   the   physician   compensation   and   professional   liability   insurance   premiums. For facility-based services, the MFS includes the payment for physician work, professional liability insurance, and the practice expense associated with the physician (e.g., billing costs) only. A separate facility payment (e.g., Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), Ambulatory Surgical Center) covers the cost of the service when performed in that setting. With the omission of over $30 billion in physician compensation and over $7 billion in professional liability insurance premiums for most   facility-based   physicians,   the   CMS-updated   MEI   greatly   underrepresented   the   actual   proportion   of work and PLI costs that practices incur when performing services paid for by the MFS.  The AMA strongly   urges   CMS   to   correct   the   substantial   error   in   their   updated   MEI   weights   and   to   postpone implementation of the updated MEI weights until after the AMA completes its national study to collect representative data on physician practice expenses.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Topic/Subtopic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Topic/Sub-topic 05:  2B_Determination of Practice Expense RVUs\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\",\n          \"Topic/Sub-topic 07:  2E26_Payment for Caregiver Training Services\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\",\n          \"Topic/Sub-topic 04:  7C1_Resource-Based Work, PE, and MP RVUs\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"background : to ensure Medicare patients maintain or improve their access to care and to preserve the financial viability of physician practices , CMS should use every policy lever available to reduce the proposed 2024 physician payment cut.methods:we are urging both Congress and CMS to intervene before these problems get any worse . we appreciate that in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, Congress partially mitigated a 4.5 percent cut to Medicare physician payment rates , but physicians still endured two percent pay cuts this year , and for 2024 , physicians are facing another 1.25 percent cut , once again confronting the grim task of reconciling how to keep their lights on while getting paid less , while their expenses continue to rise.results:the 2024 Medicare conversion factor is proposed to be reduced by 3.36 percent from $33.8872 to $32.7476.conclusions:this is a significant issue in the long term .\",\n          \"the AMA appreciates CMS for accepting the RUC/HCPAC values as recommended for Caregiver Training Services , a series of three new CPT codes established to capture functional caregiver training services provided to caregivers without the patient present . these new codes will enhance communication between therapy practitioners, physicians, and caregivers, and reduce risk of patient injury and increase patient outcomes .

Finally, please consider the following feedback for prior summarizations done by different models (their strengths and weakness to be addressed in your summaries as identified by an SME) and try to be sure that the feedback is considered in your summarization results.\n",

        "1.\tSentences recapping what CMS is proposing or that go into deep background on the issue do not need to be included in the summaries. The output summary should summarize what the commenter's position and/or recommendation is without including the rehashing of CMS's proposal and all the back history and evidence that is supporting the recommendation/response.\n",
        "2.\t Short comments (<6 sentences) are tough to \"summarize\" because they are so short and copy/pasting the comment just makes the most sense. This probably applies to any original text <6 sentences in length. Generally, we wouldn't spend much time trying to paraphrase such short comment text.\n",
        "3.\tThe overall question to consider for the medium and long comments: Is it better to have something there for the reviewers to work with, even if not the right sentences were copied by the AI, than to have no pre-populated draft summaries for the reviewers to start with? This will be answered by how well your summaries capture the key aspects of the original text.\"\"\"\n",
        "#text=\"Continuation   of   Non-Facility   Payment  Rate CMS proposes that telehealth services provided to patients in their homes should be reported with place   of service (POS) code 10, which was established in the 2022 final rule. CMS established policy in the 2023 final rule that,   for calendar year 2023,   Medicare would continue paying for telehealth   services at the non-facility payment rate instead of returning to its pre-PHE policy of paying for these services at the reduced facility payment rates that apply to services provided in hospital settings. (Although the facility rates are lower than the non-facility rates, for services provided in hospitals and other facility settings, Medicare   makes   a   separate   payment   to   the   facility   in   addition   to   the   payment for the   physician   service.) In the current rule, CMS proposes to align with the telehealth-related flexibilities that were extended via the CAA, 2023, by continuing to pay for telehealth services provided to patients in their homes at the non- facility payment rate for 2024 when the services are reported with POS 10. The AMA appreciates CMS’s recognition that physicians who provide both in-person office services and telehealth services need to receive sufficient compensation to cover the expense of maintaining their medical office.\"\n",
