Through the March 31, \\n2020 COVID-19 IFC, we changed the definition of \\u201cdirect supervision\\u201d during the PHE for \\nCOVID-19 (85 FR 19245 through 19246) as it pertains to supervision of diagnostic tests, \\nphysicians' services, and some hospital outpatient services, to allow the supervising professional \\nto be immediately available through virtual presence using two-way, real-time audio/video \\ntechnology, instead of requiring their physical presence. In the CY 2021 PFS final rule (85 FR \\n84538 through 84540), we finalized continuation of this policy through the later of the end of the \\ncalendar year in which the PHE for COVID-19 ends or December 31, 2021. In the March 31, \\n2020 IFC (85 FR 19246) and in our CY 2022 PFS final rule (see 85 FR 65063), we also noted \\nthat the temporary exception to allow immediate availability for direct supervision through \\nvirtual presence facilitates the provision of Medicare telehealth services by clinical staff of \\nphysicians and other practitioners\\u2019 incident to their own professional services. This is especially \\nrelevant for services such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech language \\npathology services, since those practitioners were previously only able to bill Medicare for \\ntelehealth services under Medicare telehealth waivers that were effective during the PHE for \\nCOVID-19 (based on the emergency waiver authority established in section 1135(b)(8) of the \\nAct), until the CAA, 2023 extended the time period during which these practitioners could bill \\nfor Medicare telehealth services through December 31, 2024. We noted that sections \\n1834(m)(4)(D) and (E) of the Act specify the types of clinicians who may furnish and bill for \\nMedicare telehealth services. After December 31, 2024, the types of clinicians who may furnish \\nand bill for Medicare telehealth services include only physicians as defined in section 1861(r) of \\nthe Act and practitioners described in section 1842(b)(18)(C) of the Act.

It is the clinician\\u2019s responsibility and discretion \\nto confirm automated blood pressure monitor or device used to obtain the blood pressure is considered acceptable and reliable \\nand whether the blood pressure reading is considered accurate before documenting it in the patient\\u2019s medical record.\\nMeasure Steward: National Committee for Quality Assurance\\nHigh Priority Measure: Yes\\nMeasure Type: Intermediate Outcome\\nRationale:We propose to revise the initial patient population to specify the patient visit must occur during the measurement period. This \\nrevision provides clarification of the encounter timing. \\nAdditionally, we propose to update the denominator exclusion to include Donepezil-memantine in the list of dementia medication \\nlist, as this is an applicable medication for the purposes of the denominator exclusion. This medication is used for patients with \\ndementia and therefore aligns with intent of the measure to exclude patients with this condition from the measure.\\nWe propose to revise the measure guidance and the numerator note around remote monitoring devices for capturing blood \\npressure readings. Currently, the measure allows patient reported data using most methods of digital collection/reporting and \\nprohibits patient reported data taken with non-digital devices, such as with a manual blood pressure cuff and stethoscope. The \\nmeasure is agnostic to how the reading gets in and the documentation practice of each office; therefore, whether patient is \\n\\u201cconveying the reading to the clinician\\u201d by manually entering the BP reading (for example, patient portal) or having the device \\nauto-transmit data directly, it is the clinician\\u2019s responsibility and discretion to confirm that the automated blood pressure monitor \\nused to obtain the blood pressure is considered acceptable and reliable.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "In the Proposed Rule, CMS included five questions related to the AMA PPI Survey:\n",
        "\n",
        "a.\tIf CMS should consider aggregating data for certain physician specialties to generate indirect allocators so that PE/HR calculations based on PPI survey data would be less likely to over- allocate (or under-allocate) indirect PE to a given set of services, specialties, or practice types. Further, what thresholds or methodological approaches could be employed to establish such aggregations?\n",
        "The AMA PPI survey uses stratification to control the distribution of sampled cases, either to match the distribution of the population or to differ from it in a controlled way. The use of stratification will improve the precision of estimates, both overall and within subgroups defined by the stratification. The AMA recommends that CMS postpone any consideration of the level of granularity of specialty-level data until after the PPI demonstrates the differences and similarities of practice costs by specialty. The AMA and Mathematica could consider recommendations related to this question once the study is completed.\n",
        "\n",
        "b.\tWhether aggregations of services, for purposes of assigning PE inputs, represent a fair, stable, and accurate means to account for indirect PE across various specialties or practice types?\n",
        "The AMA believes that it is important for the CMS practice expense methodology to have a sufficient level of granularity to reflect actual practice costs incurred by physician practices. Ambulatory payment classification (APC) codes from the OPPS, for example, would not represent a fair, stable, and accurate means to account for indirect practice expense for the MFS due to lack of granularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Resource costs in the MFS are developed through an extremely granular “bottom-up” methodology in which the necessary resource costs are added line-by-line to achieve the actual costs for the physician to provide the care. In contrast, payment to facilities under the OPPS is calculated on the geometric mean of the costs of services in the same APC codes. To equate the rigorously developed line-item costs associated with services performed in the non-facility setting, with charges that are intended to be an average of “similar” services when performed in the facility is severely flawed because the two systems are making payments under vastly different assumptions.\n",
        "While hospital charge information is updated on a rolling basis, it does not mean that these cost data are more accurate. Under the OPPS, each APC is assigned a cost weight based on the geometric mean costs of all the procedures assigned to that APC. These estimated costs are derived from hospital charges adjusted to costs using each hospital’s cost to charge ratio (CCR). Rather than estimating the costs of each resource on a per line-item basis, this ratio is an average at the hospital department level. Since the creation of the OPPS, this averaging mechanism has consistently resulted in charge compression. CMS defines charge compression as the “practice of applying a lower charge markup to higher cost services and a higher charge markup to lower cost services.” As a result, the cost-based weights may reflect some aggregation bias, undervaluing high-cost items and overvaluing low-cost items when an estimate of average markup, embodied in a single CCR, is applied to items of widely varying costs in the same cost center.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For the over 8,000 CPT/Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes that have “Active” or “Restricted Coverage” status the CY2024 MFS NPRM Addendum B, there are only 162 unique APC codes in the CY2024 OPPS NPRM addendum B. Over 3,000 of the CPT/HCPCS codes that are “Active” or have “Restricted Coverage” status do not even have an assigned APC code.\n",
        "\n",
        "c.\tIf and how CMS should balance factors that influence indirect PE inputs when these factors are likely driven by a difference in geographic location or setting of care, specific to individual practitioners (or practitioner types) versus other specialty/practice specific characteristics (for example, practice size, patient population served)?\n",
        "In the PPI study, the AMA and Mathematica are controlling the number of sampled practices within strata defined by (1) specialty, (2) proportion of time in the facility setting, (3) practice size, (4) ownership type (individual ownership vs. more complex ownership types), (5) geographic region, and among practices with complex ownership, whether (6) the practice is part of a vertically integrated health system, and (7) private equity ownership.\n",
        "\n",
        "The AMA and Mathematica are using these criteria for our Initial sampling, and if there is variance in the response rates between different practice types, we will also use these criteria to adjust the sampling midway through the data collection period. Finally, the AMA and Mathematica will develop final analysis weights to adjust for the probability of selection, practice eligibility, and cooperation, ensuring selected weighted totals match marginal population totals from the sample frame. In the survey itself, participating practices are asked to split out their provider compensation and time, staffing and other direct and indirect practice expenses at the Medicare specialty level, if possible.\n",
        "The AMA and Mathematica could provide recommendations related to this question once the PPI survey is completed. The PPI sampling and weighting methodology should account for most of these factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "d.\tWhat possible unintended consequences may result if CMS were to act upon the respondents’ recommendations for any of highlighted considerations above?\n",
        "Medicare payment differentials between the MFS and the OPPS are significant and have been growing, and this may be a factor in the decline in private practice. In fact, physician survey data indicate that payment and practice costs are two of the three leading reasons for private practices selling to hospitals or health systems.3 It is important to ensure that any potential changes to CMS practice expense methodology do not further exacerbate this relationship and instead work towards correcting site of service inconsistencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "In last year’s NPRM, CMS provided an impact table related to the initiative of rebasing and revising the MEI weights. CMS noted that implementation of that change in the PE methodology would have shifted payment weights from physician work to practice expense principally favoring Diagnostic Testing Facility (+13 percent), Portable X-Ray Supplier (+13 percent), Independent Laboratory (+10 percent), and Radiation Therapy Centers (+6 percent) to the detriment of Cardiothoracic Surgery (-8 percent), Neurosurgery (-8 percent), Emergency Medicine (-8 percent), and Anesthesiology (-5 percent). Modest increases occur to specialties who provide services in the office with extremely expensive disposable supplies embedded into physician payment. Primary Care would face decreases (Family Medicine (-1\n",

Similar to that separate policy change, other changes to the PE methodology would cause massive shifts between specialties, as well as within specialties, and put the solvency of many physician practices and other health care organizations in jeopardy. Any changes that are considered should be made carefully to ensure they reflect actual practice costs incurred by physician practices. All changes that impact physician practices should be phased in.\n",

The AMA and Mathematica will evaluate the potential for nonresponse bias by conducting a nonresponse bias analysis. The AMA and Mathematica are using strata for our initial sampling, as described above. Also, if there is variance in the response rates between different practice types, these criteria will be utilized to adjust the sampling midway through the data collection period.

PE RVUs are developed by considering the direct and indirect practice resources involved in furnishing each service. Direct expense categories include clinical labor, medical supplies, and medical equipment and are determined by adding the costs of the direct resources involved with furnishing that service. Indirect expenses include administrative labor, office expense, and all other expenses and are calculated using Physician Practice Expense Information Survey (PPIS) data that demonstrated the practice expenses incurred per hour worked. If a procedure can be done in a physician office and a facility setting, there are two PE RVUs: facility and non-facility. The CY 2010 PFS final rule, as well as the “Calculations of PE RVUs under Methodology for Selected Codes” file provides more detailed descriptions of the PE RVU methodology.\n",

PE RVUs are developed by considering the direct and indirect practice resources involved in furnishing each service. Direct expense categories include clinical labor, medical supplies, and medical equipment and are determined by adding the costs of the direct resources involved with furnishing that service. Indirect expenses include administrative labor, office expense, and all other expenses and are calculated using Physician Practice Expense Information Survey (PPIS) data that demonstrated the practice expenses incurred per hour worked. If a procedure can be done in a physician office and a facility setting, there are two PE RVUs: facility and non-facility. The CY 2010 PFS final rule, as well as the “Calculations of PE RVUs under Methodology for Selected Codes” file provides more detailed descriptions of the PE RVU methodology.\n",
        "The Medicare Economic Index (MEI) is an index that measures changes in the market price of inputs used to furnish physician services. Essentially, it is a measure that takes into account inflation of costs. In CY 2023, CMS finalized to rebase and revise the MEI to reflect current market conditions, but it was not used in rate setting.\n",

PE RVUs are developed by considering the direct and indirect practice resources involved in furnishing each service. Direct expense categories include clinical labor, medical supplies, and medical equipment and are determined by adding the costs of the direct resources involved with furnishing that service. Indirect expenses include administrative labor, office expense, and all other expenses and are calculated using Physician Practice Expense Information Survey (PPIS) data that demonstrated the practice expenses incurred per hour worked. If a procedure can be done in a physician office and a facility setting, there are two PE RVUs: facility and non-facility. The CY 2010 PFS final rule, as well as the “Calculations of PE RVUs under Methodology for Selected Codes” file provides more detailed descriptions of the PE RVU methodology.\n",

        "  You should have the following format for the output: [here you will place the VERY brief summary of the comment, again: about 15-25 words, NO MORE. THe narrative of your summarization should refer to the 'COMMENT' as the Major Commentor (MC) comment in your first reference, and then MC comment after that. The second part of your response follows. Then you will complete your response with the text for the rest of the summary: first, the following header: \"RELEVANT TEXT from PROPOSED RULE (CMS-2023-0121-0001):\", then finish with the rest of the summary. The balance of your output after the first part will explain why these sentences from the reference document (refered to as the \"Regulations Propsoal\") are relevant to the MC comment. Also, BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE REGULATIONS PAGE NUMBER for any material referenced from the text. These page numbers must be HIGHLY ACCURATE, so that whatever is said to be discussed on that page is actually on that page. (Be VERY careful to compare the text to the page number.) THe page number infomration is given for each sentence, so you will be able to be sure. It will be noted in each input sentence you are given.\"\"\")\n",

PE RVUs are developed by considering the direct and indirect practice resources involved in furnishing each service. Direct expense categories include clinical labor, medical supplies, and medical equipment and are determined by adding the costs of the direct resources involved with furnishing that service. Indirect expenses include administrative labor, office expense, and all other expenses and are calculated using Physician Practice Expense Information Survey (PPIS) data that demonstrated the practice expenses incurred per hour worked. If a procedure can be done in a physician office and a facility setting, there are two PE RVUs: facility and non-facility. The CY 2010 PFS final rule, as well as the “Calculations of PE RVUs under Methodology for Selected Codes” file provides more detailed descriptions of the PE RVU methodology.\n",
