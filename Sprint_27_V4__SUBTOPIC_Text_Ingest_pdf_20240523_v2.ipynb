Claims billed with POS 02 (Telehealth Provided Other than in Patient\\u2019s Home) will continue to be paid at the PFS facility rate. As CMS is currently paying for the majority of services that will be billed with POS 10 at the PFS non-facility rate under the PHE-specific policy of paying the place of service code had the service been furnished in person, these services furnished via telehealth will largely be paid as they are currently. Therefore, the impact of this proposal will roughly neutral even if utilization remains at current levels for these services. CMS anticipates that these provisions will result in continued utilization of Medicare telehealth services during CY 2024 at levels comparable to observed utilization of these services during the PHE for COVID\\u201319.\",\n          \"Background: Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) are evidence-based guidelines that assist clinicians in selecting the imaging studies most likely to improve health outcomes for patients based on their individual clinical presentation. AUC present information in a manner that links a specific clinical condition or presentation; one or more services; and an assessment of the appropriateness of the service(s). Under Section 1834(q) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, CMS was directed to establish a program to promote AUC for advanced diagnostic imaging services. Under the AUC program, clinicians and facilities that furnish the imaging service are responsible for reporting information about the ordering clinician\\u2019s AUC consultation on the imaging service claim. \\nFour major components of the AUC program under section 1834(q) of the Act are:\\n(1) establishment of AUC by November 15, 2015;\\n(2) identification of mechanisms for consultation with AUC by April 1, 2016;\\n(3) AUC consultation by ordering professionals, and reporting on AUC consultation by January 1, 2017; and\\n(4) annual identification of outlier ordering professionals (based on low adherence to AUC) for services furnished after January 1, 2017\\n\\nCMS has taken a diligent, stepwise implementation approach to maximize the opportunity for public comment and engagement with interested parties, and allow for adequate advance notice to physicians and practitioners, beneficiaries and other AUC interested parties of any programmatic changes or updates. Currently, the AUC program is in the educational and operations testing phase that began January 1, 2020. CMS has not met the statutory implementation time frame for the AUC program components. Due to the inability of the Medicare claims processing system to automate claims processing edits that ensure only claims subject to the AUC program requirements as prescribed in section 1834(q) of the Act will be processed as such, returned or denied accordingly, CMS believes the inherent risks in terms of data integrity and accuracy, beneficiary access, and potential beneficiary financial liability for advanced diagnostic imaging services render the AUC program impracticable. Working within the parameters prescribed under section 1834(q) of the Act, CMS has not identified any practical way to move the AUC program forward beyond the educational and operations testing period. Further, without a way forward to fully implement the AUC program, CMS believes there is no utility in continuing the educational and operations testing period. CMS will continue efforts to identify a workable implementation approach and will propose to adopt any such approach through subsequent rulemaking.\\n\\nProvision: CMS proposes to  pause implementation of the AUC program for reevaluation. CMS proposes to remove the text of \\u00a7 414.94 and save for future use. This section contains the entirety of the regulations adopted in the course of implementing elements of section 1834(q) of the Act. CMS believes the removal of these regulations is consistent with their proposal to pause efforts to implement the AUC program for reevaluation, and would avoid the potential confusion that could result if the text was retained or amended at \\u00a7 414.94. CMS expects this to be a hard pause to facilitate thorough program reevaluation and, as such, we are not proposing a time frame within which implementation efforts may recommence.\",\n          \"Background:\\nSection 2005 of the SUPPORT Act created a new Medicare Part B benefit for OUD treatment services furnished by OTPs. In CY2023 PFS final rule, CMS modified the pricing of the drug component of the methadone weekly bundle and the add-on code for take home supplied of methadone by using the payment amount for methadone for CY2021 to better reflect the change in methadone costs for OTPs over time. In addition, CMS finalized modification to the payment rate for individual therapy in the non-drug component of the bundled payment for an episode of care to base the payment rate on the rate for longer therapy sessions that better account for the greater severity of needs for patients with an OUD and receiving treatment in OTP setting. Lastly, services furnished via OTP mobile units will be treated as services furnished in the physical location of the OTP. CMS believes this would allow OTPs to better serve Medicare beneficiaries in underserved areas and will continue to monitor use of OUD treatment services furnished by OTPs to ensure adequate access to care for beneficiaries. \\n\\nProvisions:\\nCMS is proposing several modifications to policies governing Medicare coverage and payment for OUD treatment services furnished by OTPs. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Pages\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 55,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 238,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24,\n        \"samples\": [\n          42,\n          24,\n          36\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

\"BACKGROUND: The Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) was established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts of 1989 and 1990. It uses a resource-based approach to calculate Practice Expense Relative Value Units (PE RVUs), which cover operational costs but exclude malpractice expenses. The PE RVUs are determined using data from various surveys like the AMA\\u2019s Socioeconomic Monitoring System and the Physician Practice Information Survey (PPIS). The calculation of indirect PE RVUs involves adjusting these RVUs based on service utilization and applying specialty-specific scaling factors. In the CY 2023 PFS final rule, CMS finalized the rebase and revision of the Medicare Economic Index (MEI) to reflect current market conditions. The new 2017-based MEI incorporates data from a variety of publicly available sources, moving away from the sole reliance on the 2006 AMA PPIS data. When Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data was unavailable for specific clinical labor types, alternative sources such as Salary Expert were utilized.\\n\\nPROVISION: From CY 2010, CMS updated the PE/HR data using PPIS, with the transition completed by CY 2013. CMS also uses cross-walks for specialties not covered by PPIS, ensuring appropriate allocation of indirect costs. The final PE RVUs are determined by adding direct and indirect PE RVUs and applying a final budget neutrality adjustment. This adjustment ensures balance in payment distribution among various specialties. Some specialties are excluded from direct rate setting but are included in the budget neutrality adjustment. These include Ambulatory surgical center (Code 49), Nurse practitioner (Code 50), Medical supply companies with certified orthotist (Code 51), certified prosthetist (Code 52), certified prosthetist-orthotist (Code 53), and others not included in these categories (Code 54). The implementation of the 2017-based MEI cost weights in PFS ratesetting will be delayed to CY 2024. For the CY 2022 PFS final rule, CMS implemented a multi-year transition to update clinical labor pricing, with the transition set over four years to reach fully updated rates by CY 2025. CMS encourages feedback and suggestions for optimal PE data collection and methodological adjustments over time. They are also interested in understanding potential contingencies or alternatives upon completion of the updated PPIS data collection effort by the AMA.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The calculation of PE RVUs involves determining direct and indirect PE, with direct PE being calculated by summing the costs of resources typically used in a service and indirect PE being calculated using per-hour data from surveys such as the PPIS. The methodology for determining PE RVUs includes several detailed steps such as calculating aggregate pools of indirect PE RVUs for all PFS services, applying adjustments to indirect allocators, and determining the final PE RVUs by adding direct PE RVUs to the adjusted indirect PE RVUs. In the CY 2023 PFS final rule, CMS finalized the rebasing and revision of the Medicare Economic Index (MEI) to better reflect current market conditions affecting physician practices, but the implementation of the 2017-based MEI cost weights in PFS ratesetting has been postponed to future rulemaking.\n\nPROVISION: The PE RVUs for a service are established by combining direct and indirect costs, considering factors like clinical labor costs or work RVUs. For services with technical and professional components, the payment sums the components, adjusted by indirect cost percentages. Starting CY 2013, PE RVUs fully incorporate PPIS data, except where specified. For services that can be provided in both facility and non-facility settings, separate RVUs are calculated, typically resulting in lower facility RVUs due to fewer resources used by physicians in these settings. For services experiencing significant RVU reductions, a phase-in approach is applied to limit the reduction impact per year. The methodology also accounts for various modifiers and adjustments in the utilization files to reflect accurate service volumes and times. For CY 2024, CMS has decided not to incorporate the 2017-based MEI in PFS ratesetting, continuing to prioritize payment stability while new practice cost data is anticipated from the AMA. CMS is seeking feedback on strategies to incorporate information that could address challenges experienced in implementing the initial AMA PPIS data.</p>\n            </div></div>"
