Essential hospitals and their patients have benefited from this flexibility during the pandemic. The use of audio-only capabilities is beneficial for vulnerable patients who do not have access to computers or phones with video capabilities and those with limited access to broadband that can support synchronous video visits. \\n\\nAEH urges CMS to continue reimbursing a subset of services and ensure payment parity for these services, conducted through audio-only technology.

LifeNet Health encourages CMS to first aligns with the HOPD Advisory Panel Recommendations to implement the previously outlined OPPS payment fixes, then CMS should consider mirroring PFS payment to the existing OPPS methodology, where a high- or low-cost bundled payment methodology has been in effect for skin substitutes since CY2015. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 2: [begin summary] The American College of Surgeons (ACS) urges CMS to abandon its efforts to treat skin substitutes as \\\"incident to\\\" supplies and to instead maintain these products as separately billable, given their concerns about the potentially drastic budget neutrality implications. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 3: [begin summary] Stryker appreciates CMS\\u2019 deliberate approach to potential reforms of its skin substitute policy and agrees that CMS should ensure that any changes in Medicare skin substitute policies do not adversely impact Medicare beneficiary access to the most clinically appropriate products. Stryker believes that additional information is needed regarding the full reach of the potential changes CMS envisions, including how CMS would determine the universe of CPT codes impacted and account for different clinical uses of skin substitute products across care settings, and urges CMS to work with stakeholders on any future policy changes and subject any reform framework to public review and comment. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 4: [begin summary] The Coalition of Wound Care Manufacturers (The \\\"Coalition\\\") recommends that CMS:\\n\\n\\u2022 Continue to make separate payment of CTPs in the Physician Fee Schedule until CMS can demonstrate, through rulemaking, that the quality of care and access to beneficiaries is not impacted as well as to demonstrate that this rule will not disproportionately impact underserved patient populations.\\n\\u2022 Report the ASP of all CTPs regardless of the HCPCS code issued\\n\\u2022 Publish all CTP ASPs in the pricing data file\\n\\u2022 Use its enforcement authority to ensure accurate and timely reporting\\n\\u2022 Publish guidance per the OIG report on appropriate ASP reporting\\n\\u2022 Meet with stakeholders to develop an alternative proposal, if the Agency does not recognize the cost savings that the data suggests will be realized over the course of the next three years.\\n\\nThe Coalition believes there is no legal basis for CMS to categorize skin substitutes as supplies or deviate from the definitions provided in the PHSA. \\n\\nThe Coalition fears changes to RVUs of \\\"incident to supplies\\\" furnished in non-facility settings will impact patient access and increase amputations. \\n\\nAdditionally, because use of cellular and/or tissue-based\\nproducts (CPTs) vary by size of wound, the Coalition believes it is difficult to assess the typical service in order to inform payment in the PE calculation. There are many products reported (currently there are over 170) with each CTP HCPCS code and no single product accounts for more than 50% of the usage. An additional difficulty in accurately assessing the cost of CTP products is due to the fact that these products vary immensely by cost as well. As a result, there are no similarly resourced groups of products/services that could inform payment stratification without risking access to services.\\n\\nThe Coalition also believes the HOPPS payment system perpetuates inequities and requests CMS consider the recommendations which the Advisory Panel on Hospital Outpatient Payment the Alliance of Wound Care Stakeholders presented. To improve consistency, the Coalition suggests using ASP +6% and avoid bundled methodology. CMS should not try to emulate a failed program in the physician office setting in order to try to achieve consistency. The only thing consistent in doing so is that the system would be a failure and patient access would be negatively impacted. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 5: [begin summary] Organogenesis agrees that the methods that CMS might employ for payment of skin substitute costs are potentially valid  but it is impossible for Organogenesis to meaningfully comment on these options based on the limited information provided in the proposed rule. \\n\\nOrganogenesis continues to recommend that the best way to achieve appropriate, fair and consistent payment for skin substitutes in the physician office is to pay separately for the product under the ASP methodology. Organogenesis recommends that CMS should require all skin substitute manufacturers to report ASP data and should include all skin substitute products in the ASP file.\\n\\nIf CMS intends to bundle payment for the skin substitute into the payment for the associated procedure in the future, CMS must provide additional technical detail, impact assessment and implementation detail (e.g., a technical road map to achieve this change in payment policy) \\u2013 with additional opportunity for stakeholder comment. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 6: [begin summary] The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) encourages the Agency to maintain skin substitute products as separately reportable HPCPS codes and to work with the AMA CPT Editorial Panel/RVS Update Committee to address potential changes in reporting structure. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 7: [begin summary] The American Medical Association (AMA) recommends that CMS separately identify and pay for high-cost disposable supplies priced at more than $500 using appropriate HCPCS codes. The pricing of these supplies should be based on a transparent process, where items are annually reviewed and updated.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 8: [begin summary] BioTissue comments that as CMS continues to evaluate the appropriate payment methodology for skin substitutes / wound management products and wound coverings, it is important for the Agency to continue to explicitly and consistently state that any such changes exclude drugs and biologic products approved by the FDA under Section 351, consistent with Section 1847A of the Act. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 9: [begin summary] The Alliance of Wound Care Stakeholders (The Alliance) states the proposed change to pay for skin substitutes as incident to supplies under the physician practice expense is extremely complex, will negatively impact patient access, and is not workable. The Alliance explains that the uses of skin substitute products vary immensely, and change based on the size of the wound, the condition of the patient, the intended use, and product type. In addition, the Alliance states that based on historical claims data, the payment per unit for skin substitute products also varies, as does the number of skin substitute product units reported on claims. The Alliance provides a list of concerns and reasons for their opposition, and states that CMS should not move forward with this proposal as it will negatively impact patient access to care. \\n\\nInstead, The Alliance highly recommends that CMS publish and pay per the Average Sales Price (ASP) methodology for all skin substitutes in order to achieve the savings and consistency discussed above and identified by the Office of Inspector General (OIG). The Alliance also highly recommends that CMS utilize its enforcement authority to ensure accurate and timely reporting is taking place.\\n [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 10: [begin summary] Integra LifeSciences believes CMS should not propose any changes to coding and payment for skin substitute products unless those proposals are supported by specific details that enable the public a full and meaningful opportunity to comment. They believe there are fundamental issues that CMS must address publicly if it were to pursue the concept of skin substitutes as supplies under the PFS methodology. In their view, these issues\\ncannot be surmounted and thus CMS should never move forward with an attempt to bring skin substitutes into the PFS as practice expenses.\\n\\nIntegra LifeSciences believes that CMS must acknowledge that its proposal that skin substitute products not be counted as refundable drugs for purpose of the discarded drug refund program in 2024 is compelled by law, regardless of the year. \\n\\nIntegra LifeSciences believes CMS should not treat differently skin substitute products with \\u201cA\\u201d codes and those with \\u201cQ\\u201d codes.

[end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 12: [begin summary] The American Academy of Dermatology Association (AADA) calls on CMS to separately pay for high-cost disposable supplies. The AADA encourages CMS to recognize that in cases where CPT codes include high-cost disposable supplies, a larger portion of indirect practice expenses is allocated to the practices that perform the service, which is subsidized by all other healthcare providers. The AADA recommends that high-cost disposables be paid separately with appropriate HCPCS codes. The AADA feels very strongly that CMS must pay for high-cost disposable supplies separately, and they support using appropriate HCPCS codes.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 13: [begin summary] Smith + Nephew (S+N) states that as CMS considers packaging approaches in the future, S+N is concerned this would inevitably reduce access and divert patients to more costly hospital inpatient settings. S+N states that moving away from physician offices as a critical site of care for large wounds would also risks increasing the number of amputations. S+N also strongly supports CMS actions aimed at eliminating incentives to use certain skin substitutes based on margins and discounts received from manufacturers.\\n\\nS+N recommends CMS to drop consideration of future payment methodologies to package the costs of skin substitutes into professional fees and move immediately to adopt average sales price (ASP) payment for all skin substitutes to reduce Medicare spending while ensuring access to the highest quality products.

Overall, there is a lack of clarity on the purpose, use and reporting of this code. The RUC shares its previous questions and concerns regarding the resources, typical patient, time, and definition, and reporting and monitoring of this visit complexity code. The February 2020 RUC recommendations on this add-on code are in Attachment 08 to the letter.\\n\\nThe RUC request that CMS restore the Refinement Panel process that served as an appeal process for those commenting on CMS proposed relative values to assist with accurately valuing E/M and other HCPCS codes.\\n\\nThe RUC notes that CMS should not use arbitrary calculations to adjust specific services performed by one specialty to address issues outside of the scope of the RBRVS payment system and suggest that access and shortage issues should be addressed through legislative solutions and properly funded.\\n\\nThe RUC notes that disseminating Medicare and Medicaid utilization data earlier would be particularly helpful to understand service utilization and to identify potentially misvalued services. The RUC also notes the absence of Medicare Advantage claims data. Since the number of patients in this program has increased, it is important to investigate mechanisms to collect this information.\\n\\nFinally, the RUC strongly objects to questions around whether the AMA RUC is the best positioned to provide recommendations to CMS about physician services. \\n [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 3: [begin summary] Premier, Inc. supports establishment of new add-on code for complex patients, G2211, that could be reported with office and outpatient (O/O) evaluation and management (E/M) codes.

If additional medical record documentation is expected to support G2211 billing, ASTCT asks that CMS provide explicit guidance.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 6: [begin summary] The Alliance of Dedicated Cancer Centers (ADCC) asks CMS to continue to work with AMA to ensure that Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) level II codes are no longer needed for E/M services, such as prolonged services and the new G2211 add-on code. The ADCC also recommend that CMS work with the AMA to recognize services described by HCPCS add-on code G2211. While generally supportive of this policy, the ADCC is concerned about the potential negative impact on the conversion factor and budget neutrality calculations if the code\\u2019s use grows beyond CMS estimates. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 7: [begin summary] The Primary Care Development Corporation (PCDC) Strongly supports the G2211 code because it offsets the impact of the conversion factor this year, but should only be an incentive and not a permanent replacement for current reimbursement rates. Using it to offset cuts will undermine its purpose and will not allow practices\\nto implement the comprehensive, whole person care the code was intended to support.\\n\\nPCDC urges CMS to avoid interference with its implementation because it will advance more appropriate payments for, and encourage providers to engage patients in, longitudinal continuous care. Implementing G2211 will advance several of CMS\\u2019 strategic priorities by helping to stabilize and strengthen community-based primary care practices. For these reasons, PCDC urges CMS to institute the G2211 add-on code without any further delay. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 8: [begin summary] The American Nurses Association (ANA)strongly urges CMS to finalize the proposal to activate HCPCS code G2211. Additionally, ANA agrees that G2211 should not be reportable when the provider reports an E/M code\\nalong with payment modifier 25.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 9: [begin summary] The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) strongly supports CMS\\u2019 plan to fully implement the G2211 add-on code in 2024 and greatly appreciates CMS adjusting its utilization assumptions for the code according to our feedback. The AAFP believes that the resource-based relative value mandates this gap be filled by G2211 and doing so is consistent with CMS\\u2019 mission. The AAFP supports CMS\\u2019 proposal to disallow payments for G2211 when it is billed alongside an E/M visit and a minor procedure provided at the same encounter. The AAFP believes there should be an exception for E/M services billed on the same day as a Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV). The AAFP urges CMS to allow physicians billing a Medicare AWV on the same day as an E/M visit (and therefore with a -25 modifier) to also be paid for the G2211 add-on code. The AAFP recommends CMS invest resources in additional, supplemental sources of information, especially physician time, rather than relying almost exclusively on the RUC. The AAFP strongly recommends that CMS revalue the global surgical codes. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 10: [begin summary] Abbott appreciates that CMS has revised the prior utilization estimates for G2211 by the specialties that bill E/M codes, which somewhat reduced the corresponding budget neutrality adjustment for other surgical and non-primary specialties (e.g., pathology), and thus the necessary budget neutrality adjustment. However, they believe that the disproportionate cuts to office-based specialists could threaten Medicare beneficiary access to specialty services in the office setting. Abbott encourages CMS to examine its administrative authorities to mitigate these reductions, such as by adjusting the budget neutrality expenditure threshold for inflation, so that reimbursement to physicians better reflects rising practice costs.

Allowing G2211 to go into effect is not appropriate and will cause further erosion of the MPFS. However, if the Agency chooses to proceed with its implementation, clear coding guidance on its use is needed, as we anticipate that it will be used frequently by radiation oncologists given the complexity associated with cancer care [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 12: [begin summary] The American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) appreciate the agency\\u2019s acceptance of 91% of RUC-passed values, which are based on valid, clinically relevant information that preserves relativity. They believe the RUC is the entity best positioned to provide recommendations to CMS on resource inputs for work, PE and professional liability valuations and to establish values for E/M and other physicians\\u2019 services. The AANS and CNS urge CMS to permanently halt the implementation of the G2211 code.\\nAt the very least, rather than making any utilization assumptions \\u2014 which are speculative at best \\u2014 CMS should track G2211 code utilization before making additional cuts to the CF. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 13: [begin summary] The American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology (AANA) appreciates CMS' consideration of how they can potentially move forward with reforms to the way they establish values for E/M and other services.\\n\\nThe AANA does not believe that the AMA RUC is the entity best positioned to provide recommendations to CMS on resource inputs for work and PE valuations, as well as how to establish values for E/M and other physicians\\u2019 services. The AANA believes that healthcare equity must also include equitable representation of advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), including certified registered nurse astrologists (CRNAs) in the valuation process. Therefore, the AANA requests that CMS develop an equitable valuation process which allows full participation by APRNs to better reflect the clinicians providing care to Medicare beneficiaries. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 14: [begin summary] Michigan Medicine (MM) believes more clarity is needed around the use of this new code. MM is concerned that this add-on code structure will add unnecessary documentation and code selection burden to already burdened primary care physicians. MM would recommend that any work to address distortions in resource allocations under the PFS maintains a focus on documentation and code selection burden reduction. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 15: [begin summary] The American Society of Pediatric Nephrology (ASPN) continues to support CMS\\u2019 implementation of the outpatient evaluation and management (E/M) complexity add-on code G2211. ASPN states that most of the care delivered by their members fits within the definition for the code, namely \\u201cmedical care services that are part of ongoing care related to a patient\\u2019s single, serious, or complex condition.\\u201d ASPN states that the proposed add-on payment will recognize the additional work effort required by pediatric nephrologists in caring for children with serious, complex conditions such as ESRD with a kidney transplant.\\n [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 16: [begin summary] The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is strongly supportive of the establishment of HCPCS code G2211. The AAN agrees with CMS that implementation of G2211 is necessary to accurately account for the cost associated with the longitudinal care of complex patients.\\n\\nThe AAN appreciates CMS\\u2019s decision to ensure that the code is available to both new and established patients. the AAN appreciates that CMS has heeded the AAN\\u2019s advice and listed several examples that do not meet CMS\\u2019s definition of a \\u201csingle serious condition or a complex condition.\\n\\nThe AAN notes that while the code may be widely applicable, historical precedent indicates that utilization could be far lower initially. In developing the appropriate estimate, CMS could examine the past utilization history for Transitional Care Management (TCM) codes (99495 & 99496). The AAN believes that adoption ofG2211 will be slow at first and follow a similar trend. The AAN firmly believes CMS should be cognizant of the historical uptake of similar codes when determining appropriate utilization estimates and that CMS should consider the need to further revise its utilization estimates, so as to not overestimate the redistributive impacts of implementing G2211 on the Medicare conversion factor.\\n\\nThe AAN believes that while O/O E/M office visits occurring on the same day as a minor procedure may for the most part have resources appropriately captured by the procedure code, the AAN believes that a blanket exclusion may not be appropriate and that\\nthere may be a need for limited exceptions.\\n\\nThe AAN concurs with commenters that the agency should prioritize addressing \\u201cgrowing distortions in resource allocations under the PFS for certain types of services, including evaluation and management visits and other non-procedural/non-surgical services.\\u201d Additionally, the AAN appreciates CMS\\u2019 commitment to ensuring that \\u201cdata collection from, and documentation requirements for, physician practices are as least burdensome as possible while also maintaining strong program integrity requirements.\\u201d The AAN is concerned with the structural impacts of passive devaluation on all services in the MPFS, particularly on the E/M codes. The AAN urges CMS to work with Congress to ensure that cognitive work maintains its appropriate value.\\n\\nRecognizing CMS\\u2019s interest in reform, the AAN\\u2019s answers to selected CMS\\u2019s questions are as follows:\\n\\na. Do the existing E/M HCPCS codes accurately define the full range of E/M services with appropriate gradations for intensity of services?\\n\\nThe AAN strongly believes that there is a need to account for this higher acuity and for the cost associated with the longitudinal care of complex patients. The AAN believes that rapid implementation of G2211 is a necessary step in accounting for this higher acuity and complexity. The AAN is highly supportive of the use of telehealth to deliver E/M services as well as the implementation of the non-face-to-face codes.\\n\\nb. Are the methods used by the RUC and CMS appropriate to accurately value E/M and other\\nHCPCS codes?\\n\\nThe AAN believes that time and motion studies could be used to more accurately determine the resources needed in a resource-based relative value scale reimbursement program.\\n\\ne. What are the consequences if services described by HCPCS codes are not accurately defined? The misuse of this code led to increased\\ninappropriate utilization and a subsequent substantial reduction in reimbursement for neurologists. This has had long-term negative impacts on neurology departments and on access to neurologic care.\\n\\nf. What are the consequences if services described by HCPCS codes are not accurately valued?\\nAAN states the healthcare system can become distorted as financial incentives at least partially drive behavior, rather than the goal of delivering medically appropriate care and promoting population health.\\n\\n\\n [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 17: [begin summary] Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association (VHHA) supports the new G2211 add-on code as it will help to account for the goods and services utilized for complex patients.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 18: [begin summary] The American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) opposes the creation of the G2211 E/M add-on code. G2211 has not been validated by the RUC and CMS should not ignore the RUC's recommendations. ASRS is concerned that CMS has grossly overestimated the utilization of G2211, thereby necessitating a significant budget neutrality adjustment to the conversion factor that will lead to cuts across all of medicine. They urge CMS not to finalize this code and recommend that CMS broadly revisit its utilization calculations during the payment year or in future years to prevent further unwarranted value redistributions. \\n\\nASRS is a strong supporter of the transparent RUC process and would oppose any attempt to side-step or abandon it as part of the RBRVS process for any code set, including E/M. ASRS strongly recommends CMS recommit itself to honoring the consensus-driven and evidence-based RUC process that applies a consistent and transparent methodology for identifying misvalued codes and accurately revaluing them. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 19: [begin summary] The American College of Radiology (ACR) does not support the implementation of G2211 for these reasons:\\n\\nG2211 is no longer justified\\nThis code was created because CMS\\u2019s original policy called for a single payment rate for O/O E/M visit levels 2-5 and that additional non-face-to-face time performed by primary care other specialty services needed to be accounted for. However, the new coding structure for O/O E/M incorporates both non-face-to-face time and face-to-face time and also includes the work and time for three days prior and seven days after the encounter. Physicians can bill the higher-level E/M codes to account for the total time, including non-face-to-face time.\\n\\nG2211 is duplicative of separately reportable work\\nThe ACR believes that any additional resources can be reported by other newly developed codes for ongoing care, which can be added to a single office visit. These includes codes for principal care management (PCM), chronic care\\nmanagement (CCM), complex care management (Complex CCM), transitional care management (TCM), the prolonged services code, remote physiologic monitoring, and remote therapeutic\\nmonitoring (RTM). The implementation and use of G2211 to report these additional resources will be duplicative of the work described by the existing codes and result in overpayments. In turn, in order to maintain budget neutrality, the conversion factor will need to be decreased, which impacts physician payments.\\n\\nG2211 is not resource-based\\nAs previously stated, CMS has been vague in defining the additional resources that are meant to be described by HCPCS code G2211. The RVUs assigned to G2211 were based on mitigating any payment instability for physicians and considerations of budget neutrality. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 20: [begin summary] Texas Medical Association (TMA) appreciates CMS' efforts to pay properly for E/M services but remains concerned that, due to the confines of budget neutrality legislative requirements, payment for the O/O E/M visit complexity add-on negatively impacts certain physician specialties that do not predominantly utilize E/M codes. TMA encourages CMS to provide more clarification and examples on when physicians can use this code. TMA also recommends that CMS apply the office visit E/M increases uniformly across all services and specialties.    [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 21: [begin summary] The Healthcare Business Management Association (HBMA) believes that the 2024 proposed E/M complexity add-on G code creates multiple operational issues and increases the probability of physicians misunderstanding and resulting in coding errors. HBMA recommends CMS delay implementation of the proposed new G code for complexity to allow a far more detailed analysis of how best to achieve improved beneficiary care based on SDOH. HBMA also recommends CMS cease creating unique codes that are not consistent with CPT and that result in increased physician burden, cost and frustration. They also recommend thoughtful consideration of the increased beneficiary cost share that may have the unintended consequences of discouraging participation in the care needed.\\n\\nHBMA also supports CMS' collaboration with AMA and other interested parties to update coding and payment for E/M visits so that the policies better reflect the current practice of medicine, are less administratively complex, and are paid more accurately under the PFS. Although CMS stated, \\u201cThis work is critical to improve payment accuracy and help reduce practitioner burnout,\\u201d many of the proposed rules create a higher burden by adding unnecessary complexity, coding guideline confusion, reduced efficiency, and increased cost.

The Academy has expressed in the past that implementation of G2211 is contradictory to the reason for which the code was initially established.  The Academy feels CMS\\u2019s overall utilization estimates of 38 percent in 2024 and 54 percent once the code is fully adopted are overstated. The Academy has serious concerns about increasing the financial burden on Medicare beneficiaries. Though the budget neutrality adjustment for 2024 accounts for the impacts of G2211 utilization on net beneficiary out-of-pocket costs, it does not reflect the impact to Medicare patients individually. The Academy strongly urges CMS to abandon plans to implement G2211. At a minimum, the Academy respectfully asks that CMS revise the utilization assumptions for G2211 to mitigate the negative impact on the conversion factor for all Medicare providers.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 31: [begin summary] The American College of Surgeons (ACS) strongly urges CMS not to implement G2211.

[end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 42: [begin summary] The American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) appreciates CMS\\u2019 proposed reassessment of G2211 utilization. They urge CMS to reassess its utilization assumptions for G2211 and consider the impacts to beneficiaries in the form of cost-sharing.\\n\\nASE is concerned that CMS is soliciting feedback on how to establish E/M values and caution careful consideration of other resources such as those that rely only on time data and do not address other factors such as complexity and intensity, which are necessary components when determining the value of services and procedures. They urge CMS to consider restoring the Refinement Panel process that served as an appeals process for those commenting on CMS proposed relative values. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 43: [begin summary] Given the anticipated widespread applicability of this code and the proposed revisions for CY 2024 to restrict use of the add-on code when modifier 25 is present, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) urges CMS to provide clear guidance and education to clinicians ahead of CY 2024 to ensure appropriate coding. CMS should also carefully monitor utilization of this code to ensure that its estimates for budget-neutrality purposes are reasonably accurate. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 44: [begin summary] The California Medical Association (CMA) urges CMS to further reduce the utilization assumption on the new E/M add-on code G2211 consistent with the data provided by several medical organizations. CMS generally supports the new E/M add-on code G2211 to reflect the provision of more complex care of sicker patients needing more coordination among physician specialists. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 45: [begin summary] Vizient remains concerned that the potential impact of this proposed code may be disruptive and have variable impacts depending on the type of provider. While Vizient agrees that providers should be adequately reimbursed for the treatment of complex patients, the agency states that this code will primarily be used in primary care, and the agency does not anticipate the use of this code in specialties without longitudinal patient relationships, such as surgical specialties. To minimize disruption, Vizient encourages CMS to refrain from implementing a budget neutrality adjustment for CY 2024, especially as actual utilization of this code remains to be seen. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 46: [begin summary] The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) supports the reintroduction of the outpatient office code, but advocates for a comprehensive reform of the Medicare reimbursement program to allow for more accurate representation of medical decision-making.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 47: [begin summary] The American Society of Hematology (ASH) thanks CMS for proposing to reimburse providers for the complexity add-on code G2211, and agrees that the code reflects the time, intensity, and practice expense (PE) resources involved when practitioners furnish the kinds of E/M office visit services that enable them to build longitudinal patient relationships.\\n\\nASH also provides feedback related to CMS's request for comment about evaluating E&M services more regularly and comprehensively.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 48: [begin summary] The Society of General Internal Medicine (SGIM) urges CMS to implement the complexity add-on code G2211 as proposed. G2211 is necessary to support the resources required to maintain continuous patient care. As internal medicine specialists practicing primary care, SGIM members are aware of the resources required to maintain access between a patient and a physician between visits. Providing payment for G2211 reflects the resources required to support longitudinal care outside of the time spent and services provided on the calendar day of a face-to-face visit beyond what is captured by the current E/ M service codes and, most importantly, the infrastructure required to maintain a continuous relationship with each individual patient. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 49: [begin summary] The Coalition of State Rheumatology Organizations (CSRO) appreciates the intent behind this new code and welcomes additional reimbursement for the longitudinal care provided to patients with complex, chronic rheumatologic diseases. CSRO believe the care it provides has largely been undervalued under the current E/M service codes, as it fails to account for its expertise and additional training as a cognitive specialty. Moreover, CMS no longer pays for consultation codes, despite the increased work that is involved in delivering this service. CSRO states that CMS should consider these sentiments as part of its request for comment on more regular and comprehensive reviews of E/M services. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 50: [begin summary] The American Optometric Association (AOA) opposes implementation of the G2211 add-on code. AOA is  concerned there will be confusion regarding the appropriate use of this code and believe that it\\u2019s critical for CMS and Congress to address the flaws in the Medicare payment system, rather than develop new coding that benefit only certain provider types. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 51: [begin summary] Movement is Life (MIL) supports CMS' proposal to introduce add-on code G2211. They believe this code will enhance care management for patients, improving care outcomes and patient satisfaction. However, MIL suggests that Medicare should expand care management coverage for specialty providers, recognizing that specialists often play a significant role in managing a patient's condition, even if the patient initially consults a specialist without involving a primary care provider. They advocate for acknowledging the involvement of specialists in patient care management in future coverage policies for care management. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 52: [begin summary] American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation agrees that delivery of longitudinal care increases time, intensity, and practice expense involved in managing patients\\u2019 care and that G2211 holds promise for more accurately reimbursing. Thus, American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation urges CMS to provide more guidance to help physicians and other billing practitioners better understand the conditions under which use of the code is appropriate. In addition, American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation urges CMS to reduce utilization management assumptions for G2211.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 53: [begin summary] The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) agrees with CMS that this add-on payment would improve the accuracy of payment for primary and longitudinal care. APhA asks CMS to specifically recognize \\\"pharmacists\\\" and any related pharmacist-provided patient care service utilized in this context. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 54: [begin summary] The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) believes the utilization estimates are wildly high and, at a minimum, CMS should revisit these estimates. ASPS notes CMS could avoid the drastic 2024 budget neutrality adjustment by simply rescinding its proposal to begin paying for G2221, and is currently the most significant opportunity before CMS.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 55: [begin summary] The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) believes G2211 remains duplicative of work already accounted for by existing codes and, if implemented, it will inappropriately result in overpayments to those using it because the appropriate use is not well defined. ASA strongly urges CMS not to implement code G2211. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 56: [begin summary] The National Association of ACOs (NAACOS) appreciates CMS' recognition of the complexity in delivering primary care and supports the implementation of HCPCS code G2211. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 57: [begin summary] The American Academy of Home Care Medicine (Academy) or (AAHCM) appreciates CMS\\u2019 efforts to ensure proper reimbursement for complex patient care, and agrees with CMS that there is a need for the G2211 code. Given the importance of this code, the Academy strongly opposes the exclusion of HBPC providers from billing the office/ outpatient (O/O) E/M visit complexity add-on code. The reduced conversion factor will reduce already low reimbursement for a broad array of providers, including HBPC providers caring for the sickest, most complex and expensive patients. The Academy is concerned that the omission of home care providers from billing the complexity add-on code disregards the essential role home care providers play in addressing the health care needs of the sickest Medicare patients and reflects a lack of recognition of the overall value of home-based medical care in terms of patients, caregivers, and payers. \\n\\nThe Academy also provides feedback on how CMS might evaluate E/M Services more regularly and comprehensively.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 58: [begin summary] The Endocrine Society is pleased to see that Medicare will finally reimburse for the G2211 code and recommends that CMS finalize payment. The Endocrine Society also thanks CMS for revising the add-on code's utilization assumptions and providing more detailed information on how this service can be billed. However, the Endocrine Society suggests that the agency provide further guidance as to the documentation requirements, how often the code may be billed, and other guidance that may be helpful to ensure that the code is being used in the manner for which it was intended. The Endocrine Society also responds to CMS' request for comments regarding evaluating E/M services more regularly and comprehensively.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 59: [begin summary] The Emergency Department Practice Management Association (EDPMA) opposes the introduction of and payment for G2211 because it is poorly defined and will create confusion about how and when it is appropriate to bill and is likely described by already existing care management services. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 60: [begin summary] The American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) and the Outpatient Ophthalmic Surgery Society (OOSS) urge CMS to eliminate the complexity add-on code (HCPCS code G2211) that is responsible for more than half of the estimated reduction to the CY 2024 PFS conversion factor because they find it unnecessary and inappropriate. They believe that all physicians, including those the add-on code and associated payment aims to assist, face difficulty in the current fiscal climate, so policies that unnecessarily and inappropriately reduce the conversion factor must be avoided.\\n\\nThe American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) urges CMS to apply the increased E/M values as finalized in the CY 2021 PFS to the post-operative E/M visits in 10- and 90-day global surgical procedure codes. They claim that CMS\\u2019 policy runs counter to the law/precedent and that CMS should comply with the law and increase the value of post-operative E/M visits included in global surgery bundles to be equal to the value of standalone E/M services. \\n\\nWith regard to the request for comment about evaluating E/M services more regularly, the commenters disagree that a separate \\u201cpanel\\u201d is needed to value E/M and similar services beyond the processes convened by the AMA, where CMS and primary care specialties actively participate, and those that CMS undertakes on its own. They claim that any effort to duplicate the AMA RUC process solely for the purpose of valuing E/M services would be a misuse of taxpayer funds that Congress appropriates to CMS each year to administer the Medicare program. We strongly oppose the establishment of a duplicative process to the AMA CPT and RUC for valuing E/M and other primary care services. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 61: [begin summary] The American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) urges CMS to rescind its proposal to implement reimbursement in CY 2024 for G2211 and to withdraw G2211 as a reportable, payable code and to make no further proposals regarding payment for G2211 in future rulemaking. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 62: [begin summary] The National Association of Rehabilitation Providers and Agencies (NARA) supports the comments and findings submitted by the AMA on August 14, 2023 on this topic and requests that CMS put a moratorium on the implementation of G2211. NARA believes the G2211 code is duplicative of work already described in other CPT codes.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 63: [begin summary] The American Association of Clinical Urologists (AACU) would like to commend CMS on its policy recommendations regarding the G2211 complex care add-on code and requests further details around the indications and required documents for this code.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 64: [begin summary] The American Osteopathic Association (AOA) appreciates CMS's efforts to support payment for E/M services, but have several concerns. They call for greater clarity on when G2211 should be reported, question CMS's assumptions about the code's utilization and its impact on budget neutrality, and feel CMS' estimates are overly optimistic. They believe that the initial adoption rates projected by CMS are unlikely to be realized without clear guidance and concerted educational efforts.\\n\\nThe American Osteopathic Association (AOA) believes that the current HCPCS codes for Evaluation and Management (E/M) services effectively define the full range of these services, albeit with some concerns about Medicare payment reflecting the total cost of physician activities. Regarding the entity best suited to provide recommendations for resource inputs and service valuations, AOA strongly supports the American Medical Association's Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC), feeling the RUC is uniquely capable of accurately evaluating service values and no other entity can match its expertise and breadth of specialty input. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 65: [begin summary] The Federation of American Hospitals (FAH) believes in the intent of this proposal but are concerned about ensuring clarity around the new policy. As such, FAH urges CMS to actively monitor the G2211 code and course correct as necessary, to ensure usage of the code is meeting the intent of the policy without redistributive affects that would affect patient access to care across all specialties. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 66: [begin summary] American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) does not object to the creation of evaluation and management (E/M) add-on code for complex patients. However, as ASHP has previously stated to the agency, ASHP remain concerned that CMS\\u2019s payment policy for evaluation and management (E/M) coding for pharmacist-provided incident-to services threatens patient access to vital services such as comprehensive medication management (CMM) and chronic disease management.\\n\\nLimiting coding for incident-to services ignores the essential role pharmacists play in treating patients in the ambulatory care space and the value and expertise they provide to their healthcare teams. Pharmacists\\u2019 expertise is critical to quality patient care. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 67: [begin summary] Kidney Care Partners (KCP) supports the proposal to adopt a separate add-on payment for HCPCS code G2211. They urge CMS to finalize the complexity add-on and support its use for individuals with Chronic Kidney Disease. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 68: [begin summary] The Adventist Health Policy Association (AHPA) recommends that CMS delay the implementation of this complexity add-on code G2211. While AHPA appreciates that CMS is trying to better compensate providers for the work they do managing complex medical needs, the budget neutral mandate will only shift the issue of low compensation to other provider types. Increasing payment to a select group of providers at the expense of others is short sighted and will ultimately restrict access to care. Last year, CMS also stated its intent to tie 100% of reimbursements to value-based contracts by 2030. This means that by 2030, most Medicare beneficiaries would be receiving care through an alternative payment model in which payments are already risk-adjusted for complex patients. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 69: [begin summary] The American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) appreciates that CMS has revised its assessment of this policy\\u2019s impact on the conversion factor. However, The American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) encourages CMS to further reevaluate those assumptions to align with experience with newly introduced coding for services.\\n\\nBy paying clinicians for providing this highly effective, low-cost care, G2211 will help improve patient and population health outcomes and strengthen the Medicare program.

Payment for code G2211 is not justified because under the new\\ncoding structure, physicians, and qualified health care professionals (QHPs) have the flexibility to bill a higher-level E/M code to account for increased patient complexity or a higher-level code based on total time, which includes non-face-to-face time, even if the encounter itself was not complex.\\n\\nIf implemented, this code will inappropriately result in overpayments to those using it while at the same time\\npenalizing all physicians with the reduced conversion factor required to maintain budget neutrality. Although in the\\nproposed rule CMS somewhat mitigated the cut's impact on the conversion factor by estimating lower utilization\\nassumptions for implementing G2211, CMS also states that approximately 90 percent of the budget neutrality\\nadjustment for CY 2024 is attributable to G2211. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 74: [begin summary] The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) is still very unclear on the requirements for the service and whether interventional cardiologists would be\\nable to use the code. Clarification of documentation requirements is necessary to fully understand the code\\u2019s intended use and properly estimate its utilization. \\n\\nAs interventional cardiologists bill a large number of procedures, SCAI has concerns about the negative impact of the budget neutrality reductions on the specialty, especially given the ambiguous description of G2211 and our inability to determine if interventional cardiologists will receive any benefit from being able to bill the code.

The SVS requests more timely access to Medicare and Medicaid data. Finally, SVS encourages CMS to address issues that involve a limited number of providers directly with those providers and to avoid creating far-reaching policy changes that impact an entire specialty or group of related specialties [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 78: [begin summary] Kaiser Permanente supports CMS' proposal to make HCPCS code G2211 separately payable but recommends CMS also allow for G2211 to be payable when the O/O E/M visit is reported with payment modifier 25. Kaiser Permanente also suggests CMS provide more specific instructions for the use of G2211.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 79: [begin summary] The Alliance of Specialty Medicine is concerned that creating a second process focused exclusively on establishing E/M service values would be duplicative and derive lower RVUs for physician services. CMS is already engaged in the AMA RUC process, and they ask that staff who attend be forthright about concerns with physician service values as they are being evaluated during the RUC meetings rather than using separate processes established by the agency. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 80: [begin summary] The AMA appreciates CMS' proposed reassessment of G2211 utilization in 2024 in response to AMA advocacy, but nonetheless strongly echoes the concerns raised by various stakeholders regarding the new utilization assumptions. The AMA believes that the lack of clarity surrounding the appropriate circumstances for reporting this code, combined with potential implications for patient cost-sharing has created significant ambiguity among health care practitioners. The AMA also responds to CMS' solicitations regarding evaluating E/M services more regularly and comprehensively. CMS notes that approximately 90 percent of the -2.17 percent budget neutrality adjustment is attributable to G2211.\\n\\nWithout further clarity, physicians will be less likely to report this code, and it calls into serious question CMS\\u2019s assumption that more than one-in-three office visits will include this add-on code in 2024.\\n [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 81: [begin summary] The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) support CMS\\u2019 proposal to create and implement an add-on G-code to better recognize and reimburse for physicians caring for Medicare beneficiaries with complex chronic conditions.

ACP believes G2211 will help promote beneficiaries' timely access to primary care and other continuous services that promote better health and reduce spending, and will also advance more appropriate payments for primary care and other longitudinal continuous care under the Medicare PFS. ACP is confident that G2211 will help in capturing the added complexity of primary care O/O visits. ACP is pleased that CMS refined the utilization estimates for G2211 and further offers that CMS consider making the add-on code G2211 incident to a physician's service. ACP also responds to CMS' request for information about evaluating E/M services more regularly and comprehensively.

BIO supports the goal of developing and paying for this service to address patient needs with consistency and continuity over long periods of time, with the understanding that the payment is for the time, intensity, and practice expense of providing these services to patients. [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 118: [begin summary] The Large Urology Group Practice Association (LUGPA) supports the finalization of G2211, but recommends CMS consider permitting the use of the -25 modifier in the situations where the surgical code is associated with a 0-day global period and where the usual site of service is an O/O setting. As an alternative, LUGPA suggests that CPT codes 52000 and 51741 be exempt from the -25 modifier exclusion so that urologists may continue to perform these tests and be appropriately reimbursed for the simultaneous provision of longitudinal care.  [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 119: [begin summary] The American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) asks that CMS not change the status indicator for G2211 to \\u201cactive\\u201d and not begin payment for this service because:\\n\\n\\u2022 Instituting payment for G2211 will introduce disruptions to the resource-based relative value units (RVUs) under the Physician Fee Schedule.\\n\\u2022 A laborious effort was undertaken by the AMA CPT Editorial Panel to modify the evaluation and management (E&M) code set, with these changes then accepted by CMS. These changes modify and modernize the E&M code set, allowing practitioners to adequately represent the complexity of services they provide. Instituting payment for G2211 compromises the progress made and will cause confusion among practitioners.\\n\\u2022 G2211 will unfairly impact practitioners who may not be\\nable to utilize the code due to the need to maintain budget neutrality. Utilization is expected to vary significantly based on specialty and individual practitioners\\u2019 practice patterns, with only a fraction of specialties likely to be able to fully recoup the reduction based on G2211 billing.

Additionally, the APA supports ongoing reductions in administrative burdens associated with data collection and notes it may be worthwhile for CMS to explore how technology can support data collection activities. Finally, the APA notes that recommendations from the RUC should be considered along with any supplemental data presented from interested stakeholders when establishing values for E/M and other services.

Thus, the ACC suggests CMS delay the implementation of G2211, more clearly define its purpose and usage, and reduce estimated utilization.\\n\\nThe ACC believes existing E/M codes accurately define the range of E/M services as understood today. The ACC also believes the process established by the RUC to provide recommendations to CMS is appropriate. The ACC believes the CPT Editorial Panel accurately defines current Non-E/M HCPCS codes, but the applicability of the codes is limited in some instances. If HCRCS codes are not accurately defines, problems with billing and compliance will evolve. Incorrectly valued services distort relativity in the fee schedule and inaccurately shift resources. \\n [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 123: [begin summary] The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) supports proposals to establish a technical expert panel that would advise CMS on a data-driven approach to adequately value E/M codes, and offers the following responses:\\n\\na. Do the existing E/M HCPCS codes accurately define the full range of E/M services with appropriate gradations for intensity of services?\\nThe current set of E/M codes do not accurately identify and value what is provided by an ID clinician during a consultation. To address this, CMS should restore \\u201cactive\\u201d status to consultations and establish values that are commensurate with the time and expertise ID clinicians provide when delivering these services.\\n\\n\\nb. Are the methods used by the RUC and CMS appropriate to accurately value E/M and other HCPCS codes?\\nCurrent values for E/M codes, particularly inpatient, are far too low to accurately capture the value of services provided, and the methods must be improved. In particular, current approaches have no adequate way to measure the complexity of care delivered or the value of a clinician\\u2019s expertise.\\n\\ne. What are the consequences if services described by HCPCS codes are not accurately defined?\\nConfusion about when and how to use HCPCS codes can lead to clinicians  and administrative staff inadvertently misusing or misapplying a HCPCS code, leaving them vulnerable to program integrity audits. To mitigate this risk and increase beneficiary access to services codes, code\\ndescriptors should be clear and understandable, and billing and coding guidelines should be established across a range of clinician types.\\n\\nf. What are the consequences if services described by HCPCS codes are not accurately valued?\\nPoorly defined and undervalued services lead to uncompensated clinically intense E/M patient care. Inadequate reimbursement is a chief driver of workforce shortages. If there are significant workforce deficiencies, as is the case with the ID field, achieving equitable access to high quality care will be impossible. In fact, lack of a sufficient ID workforce is already contributing to inequitable outcomes for serious infections, as we have seen with COVID-19 [end summary]             \\nSUMMARY 124: [begin summary] The American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA Pain Medicine) urges CMS to delay the implementation of code G2211 until the many concerns raised about this code are addressed.

STS argues that G2211 lacks justification because the new E/M coding structure already allows flexibility in billing higher-level codes to account for complexity and time. Additionally, they contend that G2211 is duplicative as there are existing validated codes for various complexity levels and continuing care. \\n\\nSTS raises concerns about the code not being resource-based, potentially leading to payment reductions for physicians and disrupting resource-based RVUs for E/M services.
