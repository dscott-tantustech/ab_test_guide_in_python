        "excerpts = ['Request for Information (RFI): Drugs and Biologicals that are Not Usually Self-Administered by the Patient, and Complex Drug Administration Coding', 'The ACR applauds CMS’s undertaking to conduct a comprehensive review of the administration of biologicals not usually self-administered by the patient and complex drug administration coding, issues that have posed significant challenges to rheumatologists and other specialists in the House of Medicine. The ACR believes the critical components of providing best practice treatments options with biologics and immunomodulatory therapies and protecting the patient and care team relationship are at the highest level of ethical responsibility to our patients and their access to quality healthcare in treating their rheumatologic conditions.', 'CMS plays a crucial role in working with the specialties affected by these policies to identify long- term solutions to the current issues of down coding for services billed for the administration of biologics and the drugs added to the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list. The ACR is concerned that the criteria used for these two policies contradict the proposed nondiscrimination rules created for Medicare Fee-for-Service.', '“Downcoding” The downcoding of complex chemotherapy services has reached a deep concern as it relates to the billing of biologics for the treatment of most non-oncologic conditions. This is mainly due to flawed billing and coding articles created by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that have restricted which complex therapies will be reimbursed using the “chemotherapy” administration codes, forcing rheumatologists and other specialists (except for hematology and oncology) to bill these services with the therapeutic drug administration code. The advent and evolution of biologics and other immunomodulating therapies have revolutionized outcomes for patients with auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis, which carry significant morbidity, mortality, and associated healthcare and societal costs. Despite the up-front costs, adding biologics to other treatment modalities has been cost-effective in appropriate patient populations.1', 'The American Medical Association (AMA) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) states, “Chemotherapy administration codes 96401-96549 apply to parenteral administration of non- radionuclide antineoplastic drugs; and also to anti-neoplastic agents provided for treatment of noncancer diagnoses (e.g., cyclophosphamide for auto-immune conditions) or to substances such as certain monoclonal antibody agents, and other biologic response modifiers.” Yet, the MACs continue to utilize unsubstantiated criteria to determine which drugs should be defined as complex and warrant the use of complex administration codes.', 'In 2013, the American College of Rheumatology released its position outlining the common clinical situations that require the use of intravenous biologics as opposed to self-administered biologics and outlined the FDA indications, appropriate use, safety, and off-label use for biologics, which are far more complicated at the molecular level than traditional chemically synthesized drugs.2 Also, based on the evolution of biologics and monoclonal antibody treatments on the market for auto-immune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, dermatology, neurology, and other key areas of medicine, it is appropriate to review the definition of “chemotherapy,” which is no longer a useful term, as indications and toxicity should distinguish drugs. The CPT manual also states that “The highly complex infusion of chemotherapy or other drug or biologic agents requires a physician or other qualified health care professional work and/or clinical staff monitoring well beyond that of therapeutic drug agents (96360-96379) because the incidence of severe adverse patient reactions are typically greater. These services can be provided by any physician or other qualified health care professional.” Accordingly, the ACR’s position statement indicates that given the complexity associated with the design, manufacturing, and storage of biologics and differences over time in the structure, efficacy, and safety of biologics, these treatments should be supervised and carried out by specially trained physicians and advanced practitioners who have the required knowledge, training, and experience to administer biologic agents and monitor adverse reactions. The ACR recommends that CPT work with the key stakeholders to change the terminology in the manual from “chemotherapy” to “immunomodulatory” therapies, which is more in line with drug indications.', 'As a reminder, the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) Congress included language allowing the use of the chemotherapy administration code by physicians who administer non-oncologic medications in their offices. The policy also indicated that the same level of supervision was required, and there are no significant differences between earlier biologics and currently proposed biologics in their level of risk in administration. Another key point in the MMA also outlined that these treatments should cost the same to administer, including clinical labor costs, and that no specialty should be reimbursed more than the other. Unfortunately, this has also caused another issue in how “chemotherapy” is assigned with the J-codes versus monoclonal antibody and biologic therapies through HCPCS. There are more than one example of a particular drug used as cancer therapy and an immunomodulator to treat different types of arthritis and vasculitis. To reimburse differently based on specialty is not consistent with the MMA language. Also, the toxicity issues related to these infusions do not differ based on the indication of use.', 'There has been a great deal of progress in the use of biologics in many disciplines, with the expectation for continuous advancement in the future. The ACR believes that policies related to access and reimbursement for biologic treatment should be transparent and prioritize the well-being and health of patients across disease processes with a focus on reducing morbidity and mortality. We recommend that the agency convene stakeholder roundtables or workgroups to explore regulatory and legislative solutions to these policies to avoid unintended consequences with deleterious impacts on access and coverage for beneficiaries and their healthcare team.', 'Self-Administered Drug (SAD) List Reimbursement is inadequate for drugs and biologics placed on the existing Self-Administered Drug (SAD) exclusion list policy, and the process used to determine if a drug is usually self-administered by the patient lacks transparency. The ACR is deeply concerned about barriers that limit the ability of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune diseases to obtain affordable, high-quality, high-value healthcare, which includes appropriate treatment. Additionally, beneficiaries who lose access to medication by virtue of inclusion on the SAD list are at risk of delay and deprivation of therapeutic benefits. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and modern treatment approaches have revolutionized outcomes for patients with these diseases. Early aggressive therapy with various drugs, including biologics, has been shown to reduce joint damage and deformities and improve function, reducing work absenteeism, disability, death, costly procedures/surgeries, and hospitalizations.', \"The ACR affirms the ethical responsibility of the healthcare team to place the welfare of the patient above all other considerations, as well as the importance of safeguarding the patient's relationship with their healthcare team. The ACR’s goal is to preserve patients’ access to care from rheumatology specialty care teams and the therapies necessary to treat their rheumatologic conditions. The ACR believes this is an important opportunity for CMS to work with the rheumatology community and other key stakeholders as trusted voices on the critical issue of an equitable approach to the criteria for the SAD list and the billing of the complex administration services, especially as it applies to inadvertent harmful consequences related to poor access to future medications.\"]\n",

The ACR also raises concerns about the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list, arguing that the process for determining if a drug should be on the list lacks transparency and can limit patient access to necessary treatments. The ACR calls for CMS to work with stakeholders to address these issues and ensure equitable access to care. [AI Model: gpt-4 ]\n"

The ACR is concerned that the criteria used for these two policies contradict the proposed nondiscrimination rules created for Medicare Fee-for-Service.', '“Downcoding” The downcoding of complex chemotherapy services has reached a deep concern as it relates to the billing of biologics for the treatment of most non-oncologic conditions. This is mainly due to flawed billing and coding articles created by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that have restricted which complex therapies will be reimbursed using the “chemotherapy” administration codes, forcing rheumatologists and other specialists (except for hematology and oncology) to bill these services with the therapeutic drug administration code. The advent and evolution of biologics and other immunomodulating therapies have revolutionized outcomes for patients with auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis, which carry significant morbidity, mortality, and associated healthcare and societal costs. Despite the up-front costs, adding biologics to other treatment modalities has been cost-effective in appropriate patient populations.1', 'The American Medical Association (AMA) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) states, “Chemotherapy administration codes 96401-96549 apply to parenteral administration of non- radionuclide antineoplastic drugs; and also to anti-neoplastic agents provided for treatment of noncancer diagnoses (e.g., cyclophosphamide for auto-immune conditions) or to substances such as certain monoclonal antibody agents, and other biologic response modifiers.” Yet, the MACs continue to utilize unsubstantiated criteria to determine which drugs should be defined as complex and warrant the use of complex administration codes.', 'In 2013, the American College of Rheumatology released its position outlining the common clinical situations that require the use of intravenous biologics as opposed to self-administered biologics and outlined the FDA indications, appropriate use, safety, and off-label use for biologics, which are far more complicated at the molecular level than traditional chemically synthesized drugs.2 Also, based on the evolution of biologics and monoclonal antibody treatments on the market for auto-immune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, dermatology, neurology, and other key areas of medicine, it is appropriate to review the definition of “chemotherapy,” which is no longer a useful term, as indications and toxicity should distinguish drugs. The CPT manual also states that “The highly complex infusion of chemotherapy or other drug or biologic agents requires a physician or other qualified health care professional work and/or clinical staff monitoring well beyond that of therapeutic drug agents (96360-96379) because the incidence of severe adverse patient reactions are typically greater. These services can be provided by any physician or other qualified health care professional.” Accordingly, the ACR’s position statement indicates that given the complexity associated with the design, manufacturing, and storage of biologics and differences over time in the structure, efficacy, and safety of biologics, these treatments should be supervised and carried out by specially trained physicians and advanced practitioners who have the required knowledge, training, and experience to administer biologic agents and monitor adverse reactions. The ACR recommends that CPT work with the key stakeholders to change the terminology in the manual from “chemotherapy” to “immunomodulatory” therapies, which is more in line with drug indications.', 'As a reminder, the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) Congress included language allowing the use of the chemotherapy administration code by physicians who administer non-oncologic medications in their offices. The policy also indicated that the same level of supervision was required, and there are no significant differences between earlier biologics and currently proposed biologics in their level of risk in administration. Another key point in the MMA also outlined that these treatments should cost the same to administer, including clinical labor costs, and that no specialty should be reimbursed more than the other. Unfortunately, this has also caused another issue in how “chemotherapy” is assigned with the J-codes versus monoclonal antibody and biologic therapies through HCPCS. There are more than one example of a particular drug used as cancer therapy and an immunomodulator to treat different types of arthritis and vasculitis. To reimburse differently based on specialty is not consistent with the MMA language. Also, the toxicity issues related to these infusions do not differ based on the indication of use.', 'There has been a great deal of progress in the use of biologics in many disciplines, with the expectation for continuous advancement in the future. The ACR believes that policies related to access and reimbursement for biologic treatment should be transparent and prioritize the well-being and health of patients across disease processes with a focus on reducing morbidity and mortality. We recommend that the agency convene stakeholder roundtables or workgroups to explore regulatory and legislative solutions to these policies to avoid unintended consequences with deleterious impacts on access and coverage for beneficiaries and their healthcare team.', 'Self-Administered Drug (SAD) List Reimbursement is inadequate for drugs and biologics placed on the existing Self-Administered Drug (SAD) exclusion list policy, and the process used to determine if a drug is usually self-administered by the patient lacks transparency. The ACR is deeply concerned about barriers that limit the ability of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune diseases to obtain affordable, high-quality, high-value healthcare, which includes appropriate treatment. Additionally, beneficiaries who lose access to medication by virtue of inclusion on the SAD list are at risk of delay and deprivation of therapeutic benefits. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and modern treatment approaches have revolutionized outcomes for patients with these diseases.

            "Topic/Subtopic Summary:  The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has responded to a review by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) regarding the administration of biologicals not usually self-administered by the patient and complex drug administration coding. The ACR commends CMS for addressing these issues, which have posed significant challenges to rheumatologists and other specialists. The two critical issues are down coding for services billed for the administration of biologics and the addition of drugs to the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list. The ACR is concerned that the criteria used for these policies contradict proposed nondiscrimination rules for Medicare Fee-for-Service. The ACR recommends a review of the definition of \"chemotherapy\" and changing the terminology to \"immunomodulatory\" therapies in the CPT manual. The ACR advocates for reimbursement policies that prioritize patient well-being, reduce morbidity and mortality, and avoid unintended consequences that impact access and coverage for beneficiaries' healthcare. The ACR is also concerned about inadequate reimbursement and the lack of transparency in the process used to determine if a drug is usually self-administered by the patient. The ACR believes it is essential to preserve patients' access to care from rheumatology specialty care teams and the therapies necessary to treat their rheumatologic conditions.

The ACR believes the critical components of providing best practice treatments options with biologics and immunomodulatory therapies and protecting the patient and care team relationship are at the highest level of ethical responsibility to our patients and their access to quality healthcare in treating their rheumatologic conditions.', 'CMS plays a crucial role in working with the specialties affected by these policies to identify long- term solutions to the current issues of down coding for services billed for the administration of biologics and the drugs added to the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list. The ACR is concerned that the criteria used for these two policies contradict the proposed nondiscrimination rules created for Medicare Fee-for-Service.', '“Downcoding” The downcoding of complex chemotherapy services has reached a deep concern as it relates to the billing of biologics for the treatment of most non-oncologic conditions. This is mainly due to flawed billing and coding articles created by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that have restricted which complex therapies will be reimbursed using the “chemotherapy” administration codes, forcing rheumatologists and other specialists (except for hematology and oncology) to bill these services with the therapeutic drug administration code. The advent and evolution of biologics and other immunomodulating therapies have revolutionized outcomes for patients with auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis, which carry significant morbidity, mortality, and associated healthcare and societal costs. Despite the up-front costs, adding biologics to other treatment modalities has been cost-effective in appropriate patient populations.1', 'The American Medical Association (AMA) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) states, “Chemotherapy administration codes 96401-96549 apply to parenteral administration of non- radionuclide antineoplastic drugs; and also to anti-neoplastic agents provided for treatment of noncancer diagnoses (e.g., cyclophosphamide for auto-immune conditions) or to substances such as certain monoclonal antibody agents, and other biologic response modifiers.” Yet, the MACs continue to utilize unsubstantiated criteria to determine which drugs should be defined as complex and warrant the use of complex administration codes.', 'In 2013, the American College of Rheumatology released its position outlining the common clinical situations that require the use of intravenous biologics as opposed to self-administered biologics and outlined the FDA indications, appropriate use, safety, and off-label use for biologics, which are far more complicated at the molecular level than traditional chemically synthesized drugs.2 Also, based on the evolution of biologics and monoclonal antibody treatments on the market for auto-immune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, dermatology, neurology, and other key areas of medicine, it is appropriate to review the definition of “chemotherapy,” which is no longer a useful term, as indications and toxicity should distinguish drugs. The CPT manual also states that “The highly complex infusion of chemotherapy or other drug or biologic agents requires a physician or other qualified health care professional work and/or clinical staff monitoring well beyond that of therapeutic drug agents (96360-96379) because the incidence of severe adverse patient reactions are typically greater. These services can be provided by any physician or other qualified health care professional.” Accordingly, the ACR’s position statement indicates that given the complexity associated with the design, manufacturing, and storage of biologics and differences over time in the structure, efficacy, and safety of biologics, these treatments should be supervised and carried out by specially trained physicians and advanced practitioners who have the required knowledge, training, and experience to administer biologic agents and monitor adverse reactions. The ACR recommends that CPT work with the key stakeholders to change the terminology in the manual from “chemotherapy” to “immunomodulatory” therapies, which is more in line with drug indications.', 'As a reminder, the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) Congress included language allowing the use of the chemotherapy administration code by physicians who administer non-oncologic medications in their offices. The policy also indicated that the same level of supervision was required, and there are no significant differences between earlier biologics and currently proposed biologics in their level of risk in administration. Another key point in the MMA also outlined that these treatments should cost the same to administer, including clinical labor costs, and that no specialty should be reimbursed more than the other. Unfortunately, this has also caused another issue in how “chemotherapy” is assigned with the J-codes versus monoclonal antibody and biologic therapies through HCPCS. There are more than one example of a particular drug used as cancer therapy and an immunomodulator to treat different types of arthritis and vasculitis. To reimburse differently based on specialty is not consistent with the MMA language. Also, the toxicity issues related to these infusions do not differ based on the indication of use.', 'There has been a great deal of progress in the use of biologics in many disciplines, with the expectation for continuous advancement in the future. The ACR believes that policies related to access and reimbursement for biologic treatment should be transparent and prioritize the well-being and health of patients across disease processes with a focus on reducing morbidity and mortality. We recommend that the agency convene stakeholder roundtables or workgroups to explore regulatory and legislative solutions to these policies to avoid unintended consequences with deleterious impacts on access and coverage for beneficiaries and their healthcare team.', 'Self-Administered Drug (SAD) List Reimbursement is inadequate for drugs and biologics placed on the existing Self-Administered Drug (SAD) exclusion list policy, and the process used to determine if a drug is usually self-administered by the patient lacks transparency. The ACR is deeply concerned about barriers that limit the ability of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune diseases to obtain affordable, high-quality, high-value healthcare, which includes appropriate treatment. Additionally, beneficiaries who lose access to medication by virtue of inclusion on the SAD list are at risk of delay and deprivation of therapeutic benefits. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and modern treatment approaches have revolutionized outcomes for patients with these diseases. Early aggressive therapy with various drugs, including biologics, has been shown to reduce joint damage and deformities and improve function, reducing work absenteeism, disability, death, costly procedures/surgeries, and hospitalizations.', \"The ACR affirms the ethical responsibility of the healthcare team to place the welfare of the patient above all other considerations, as well as the importance of safeguarding the patient's relationship with their healthcare team.
