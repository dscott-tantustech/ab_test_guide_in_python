Reasons for this include lack of a valid justification under the E/M coding structure, duplication of documentation efforts, overpayments, and RVU disruptions. The RVS Update Committee (RUC) has previously outlined extensive concerns with CMS implementing G2211 visit complexity code. Overall, there is a lack of clarity on the purpose, use and reporting of this code. The RUC shares its previous questions and concerns regarding the resources, typical patient, time, and definition, and reporting and monitoring of this visit complexity code. The February 2020 RUC recommendations on this add-on code are in Attachment 08 to the letter.\\n\\nThe RUC request that CMS restore the Refinement Panel process that served as an appeal process for those commenting on CMS proposed relative values to assist with accurately valuing E/M and other HCPCS codes.\\n\\nThe RUC notes that CMS should not use arbitrary calculations to adjust specific services performed by one specialty to address issues outside of the scope of the RBRVS payment system and suggest that access and shortage issues should be addressed through legislative solutions and properly funded.\\n\\nThe RUC notes that disseminating Medicare and Medicaid utilization data earlier would be particularly helpful to understand service utilization and to identify potentially misvalued services. The RUC also notes the absence of Medicare Advantage claims data. Since the number of patients in this program has increased, it is important to investigate mechanisms to collect this information.\\n\\nFinally, the RUC strongly objects to questions around whether the AMA RUC is the best positioned to provide recommendations to CMS about physician services. \\n Premier, Inc. supports establishment of new add-on code for complex patients, G2211, that could be reported with office and outpatient (O/O) evaluation and management (E/M) codes. ACOFP supports the implementation of the complexity add-on code for appropriate reimbursement, but argue the budget neutrality requirement will negate the code's benefits. American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) asks that CMS release more guidance regarding its expectations of specialists' use of HCPCS code G2211 for longitudinally treating a patient's single, serious, or complex condition for separate payment. If additional medical record documentation is expected to support G2211 billing, ASTCT asks that CMS provide explicit guidance.  The Alliance of Dedicated Cancer Centers (ADCC) asks CMS to continue to work with AMA to ensure that Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) level II codes are no longer needed for E/M services, such as prolonged services and the new G2211 add-on code. The ADCC also recommend that CMS work with the AMA to recognize services described by HCPCS add-on code G2211. While generally supportive of this policy, the ADCC is concerned about the potential negative impact on the conversion factor and budget neutrality calculations if the code\\u2019s use grows beyond CMS estimates. The Primary Care Development Corporation (PCDC) Strongly supports the G2211 code because it offsets the impact of the conversion factor this year, but should only be an incentive and not a permanent replacement for current reimbursement rates. Using it to offset cuts will undermine its purpose and will not allow practices\\nto implement the comprehensive, whole person care the code was intended to support.\\n\\nPCDC urges CMS to avoid interference with its implementation because it will advance more appropriate payments for, and encourage providers to engage patients in, longitudinal continuous care. Implementing G2211 will advance several of CMS\\u2019 strategic priorities by helping to stabilize and strengthen community-based primary care practices. For these reasons, PCDC urges CMS to institute the G2211 add-on code without any further delay. The American Nurses Association (ANA)strongly urges CMS to finalize the proposal to activate HCPCS code G2211. Additionally, ANA agrees that G2211 should not be reportable when the provider reports an E/M code\\nalong with payment modifier 25.  The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) strongly supports CMS\\u2019 plan to fully implement the G2211 add-on code in 2024 and greatly appreciates CMS adjusting its utilization assumptions for the code according to our feedback. The AAFP believes that the resource-based relative value mandates this gap be filled by G2211 and doing so is consistent with CMS\\u2019 mission. The AAFP supports CMS\\u2019 proposal to disallow payments for G2211 when it is billed alongside an E/M visit and a minor procedure provided at the same encounter. The AAFP believes there should be an exception for E/M services billed on the same day as a Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV). The AAFP urges CMS to allow physicians billing a Medicare AWV on the same day as an E/M visit (and therefore with a -25 modifier) to also be paid for the G2211 add-on code. The AAFP recommends CMS invest resources in additional, supplemental sources of information, especially physician time, rather than relying almost exclusively on the RUC. The AAFP strongly recommends that CMS revalue the global surgical codes. Abbott appreciates that CMS has revised the prior utilization estimates for G2211 by the specialties that bill E/M codes, which somewhat reduced the corresponding budget neutrality adjustment for other surgical and non-primary specialties (e.g., pathology), and thus the necessary budget neutrality adjustment. However, they believe that the disproportionate cuts to office-based specialists could threaten Medicare beneficiary access to specialty services in the office setting. Abbott encourages CMS to examine its administrative authorities to mitigate these reductions, such as by adjusting the budget neutrality expenditure threshold for inflation, so that reimbursement to physicians better reflects rising practice costs. The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) urges the Agency to delete HCPCS Code G2211 prior to the scheduled January 1, 2024, implementation. Allowing G2211 to go into effect is not appropriate and will cause further erosion of the MPFS. However, if the Agency chooses to proceed with its implementation, clear coding guidance on its use is needed, as we anticipate that it will be used frequently by radiation oncologists given the complexity associated with cancer care The American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) appreciate the agency\\u2019s acceptance of 91% of RUC-passed values, which are based on valid, clinically relevant information that preserves relativity. They believe the RUC is the entity best positioned to provide recommendations to CMS on resource inputs for work, PE and professional liability valuations and to establish values for E/M and other physicians\\u2019 services. The AANS and CNS urge CMS to permanently halt the implementation of the G2211 code.\\nAt the very least, rather than making any utilization assumptions \\u2014 which are speculative at best \\u2014 CMS should track G2211 code utilization before making additional cuts to the CF. The American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology (AANA) appreciates CMS' consideration of how they can potentially move forward with reforms to the way they establish values for E/M and other services.\\n\\nThe AANA does not believe that the AMA RUC is the entity best positioned to provide recommendations to CMS on resource inputs for work and PE valuations, as well as how to establish values for E/M and other physicians\\u2019 services. The AANA believes that healthcare equity must also include equitable representation of advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), including certified registered nurse astrologists (CRNAs) in the valuation process. Therefore, the AANA requests that CMS develop an equitable valuation process which allows full participation by APRNs to better reflect the clinicians providing care to Medicare beneficiaries. Michigan Medicine (MM) believes more clarity is needed around the use of this new code. MM is concerned that this add-on code structure will add unnecessary documentation and code selection burden to already burdened primary care physicians. MM would recommend that any work to address distortions in resource allocations under the PFS maintains a focus on documentation and code selection burden reduction. The American Society of Pediatric Nephrology (ASPN) continues to support CMS\\u2019 implementation of the outpatient evaluation and management (E/M) complexity add-on code G2211. ASPN states that most of the care delivered by their members fits within the definition for the code, namely \\u201cmedical care services that are part of ongoing care related to a patient\\u2019s single, serious, or complex condition.\\u201d ASPN states that the proposed add-on payment will recognize the additional work effort required by pediatric nephrologists in caring for children with serious, complex conditions such as ESRD with a kidney transplant.\\n The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is strongly supportive of the establishment of HCPCS code G2211. The AAN agrees with CMS that implementation of G2211 is necessary to accurately account for the cost associated with the longitudinal care of complex patients.\\n\\nThe AAN appreciates CMS\\u2019s decision to ensure that the code is available to both new and established patients. the AAN appreciates that CMS has heeded the AAN\\u2019s advice and listed several examples that do not meet CMS\\u2019s definition of a \\u201csingle serious condition or a complex condition.\\n\\nThe AAN notes that while the code may be widely applicable, historical precedent indicates that utilization could be far lower initially. In developing the appropriate estimate, CMS could examine the past utilization history for Transitional Care Management (TCM) codes (99495 & 99496). The AAN believes that adoption ofG2211 will be slow at first and follow a similar trend. The AAN firmly believes CMS should be cognizant of the historical uptake of similar codes when determining appropriate utilization estimates and that CMS should consider the need to further revise its utilization estimates, so as to not overestimate the redistributive impacts of implementing G2211 on the Medicare conversion factor.\\n\\nThe AAN believes that while O/O E/M office visits occurring on the same day as a minor procedure may for the most part have resources appropriately captured by the procedure code, the AAN believes that a blanket exclusion may not be appropriate and that\\nthere may be a need for limited exceptions.\\n\\nThe AAN concurs with commenters that the agency should prioritize addressing \\u201cgrowing distortions in resource allocations under the PFS for certain types of services, including evaluation and management visits and other non-procedural/non-surgical services.\\u201d Additionally, the AAN appreciates CMS\\u2019 commitment to ensuring that \\u201cdata collection from, and documentation requirements for, physician practices are as least burdensome as possible while also maintaining strong program integrity requirements.\\u201d The AAN is concerned with the structural impacts of passive devaluation on all services in the MPFS, particularly on the E/M codes. The AAN urges CMS to work with Congress to ensure that cognitive work maintains its appropriate value.\\n\\nRecognizing CMS\\u2019s interest in reform, the AAN\\u2019s answers to selected CMS\\u2019s questions are as follows:\\n\\na. Do the existing E/M HCPCS codes accurately define the full range of E/M services with appropriate gradations for intensity of services?\\n\\nThe AAN strongly believes that there is a need to account for this higher acuity and for the cost associated with the longitudinal care of complex patients. The AAN believes that rapid implementation of G2211 is a necessary step in accounting for this higher acuity and complexity. The AAN is highly supportive of the use of telehealth to deliver E/M services as well as the implementation of the non-face-to-face codes.\\n\\nb. Are the methods used by the RUC and CMS appropriate to accurately value E/M and other\\nHCPCS codes?\\n\\nThe AAN believes that time and motion studies could be used to more accurately determine the resources needed in a resource-based relative value scale reimbursement program.\\n\\ne. What are the consequences if services described by HCPCS codes are not accurately defined? The misuse of this code led to increased\\ninappropriate utilization and a subsequent substantial reduction in reimbursement for neurologists. This has had long-term negative impacts on neurology departments and on access to neurologic care.\\n\\nf. What are the consequences if services described by HCPCS codes are not accurately valued?\\nAAN states the healthcare system can become distorted as financial incentives at least partially drive behavior, rather than the goal of delivering medically appropriate care and promoting population health.\\n\\n\\n Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association (VHHA) supports the new G2211 add-on code as it will help to account for the goods and services utilized for complex patients.  The American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) opposes the creation of the G2211 E/M add-on code. G2211 has not been validated by the RUC and CMS should not ignore the RUC's recommendations. ASRS is concerned that CMS has grossly overestimated the utilization of G2211, thereby necessitating a significant budget neutrality adjustment to the conversion factor that will lead to cuts across all of medicine. They urge CMS not to finalize this code and recommend that CMS broadly revisit its utilization calculations during the payment year or in future years to prevent further unwarranted value redistributions. \\n\\nASRS is a strong supporter of the transparent RUC process and would oppose any attempt to side-step or abandon it as part of the RBRVS process for any code set, including E/M. ASRS strongly recommends CMS recommit itself to honoring the consensus-driven and evidence-based RUC process that applies a consistent and transparent methodology for identifying misvalued codes and accurately revaluing them. The American College of Radiology (ACR) does not support the implementation of G2211 for these reasons:\\n\\nG2211 is no longer justified\\nThis code was created because CMS\\u2019s original policy called for a single payment rate for O/O E/M visit levels 2-5 and that additional non-face-to-face time performed by primary care other specialty services needed to be accounted for. However, the new coding structure for O/O E/M incorporates both non-face-to-face time and face-to-face time and also includes the work and time for three days prior and seven days after the encounter. Physicians can bill the higher-level E/M codes to account for the total time, including non-face-to-face time.\\n\\nG2211 is duplicative of separately reportable work\\nThe ACR believes that any additional resources can be reported by other newly developed codes for ongoing care, which can be added to a single office visit. These includes codes for principal care management (PCM), chronic care\\nmanagement (CCM), complex care management (Complex CCM), transitional care management (TCM), the prolonged services code, remote physiologic monitoring, and remote therapeutic\\nmonitoring (RTM). The implementation and use of G2211 to report these additional resources will be duplicative of the work described by the existing codes and result in overpayments. In turn, in order to maintain budget neutrality, the conversion factor will need to be decreased, which impacts physician payments.\\n\\nG2211 is not resource-based\\nAs previously stated, CMS has been vague in defining the additional resources that are meant to be described by HCPCS code G2211. The RVUs assigned to G2211 were based on mitigating any payment instability for physicians and considerations of budget neutrality. Texas Medical Association (TMA) appreciates CMS' efforts to pay properly for E/M services but remains concerned that, due to the confines of budget neutrality legislative requirements, payment for the O/O E/M visit complexity add-on negatively impacts certain physician specialties that do not predominantly utilize E/M codes. TMA encourages CMS to provide more clarification and examples on when physicians can use this code. TMA also recommends that CMS apply the office visit E/M increases uniformly across all services and specialties.    The Healthcare Business Management Association (HBMA) believes that the 2024 proposed E/M complexity add-on G code creates multiple operational issues and increases the probability of physicians misunderstanding and resulting in coding errors. HBMA recommends CMS delay implementation of the proposed new G code for complexity to allow a far more detailed analysis of how best to achieve improved beneficiary care based on SDOH. HBMA also recommends CMS cease creating unique codes that are not consistent with CPT and that result in increased physician burden, cost and frustration. They also recommend thoughtful consideration of the increased beneficiary cost share that may have the unintended consequences of discouraging participation in the care needed.\\n\\nHBMA also supports CMS' collaboration with AMA and other interested parties to update coding and payment for E/M visits so that the policies better reflect the current practice of medicine, are less administratively complex, and are paid more accurately under the PFS. Although CMS stated, \\u201cThis work is critical to improve payment accuracy and help reduce practitioner burnout,\\u201d many of the proposed rules create a higher burden by adding unnecessary complexity, coding guideline confusion, reduced efficiency, and increased cost. The American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) continues to support the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\\u2019 implementation of the outpatient evaluation and management (E/M) complexity add-on code G2211. The American Academy of Audiology strongly encourage delaying the implementation of G2211 until appropriate use, reporting and education can be completed. However, should the proposal move forward, they encourage the authorization of new services by Congress to allow the addition of G2211 (formerly GPC1X) without having to apply budget neutrality, as it represents currently unreimbursed services. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) appreciate CMS\\u2019 proposed utilization reassessment of G2211. However, the societies continue to have concerns regarding CMS\\u2019 utilization estimates. The societies states that given the barriers to uptake of this code, including reporting and documentation instruction ambiguity and concerns about patient cost-sharing obligations, they urge CMS to reassess its utilization assumptions for G2211.\\n\\nIn terms of the reforms to E/M and other services, the gastroenterology societies voiced frustration at the lack of rationale provided for CMS\\u2019 decisions when they differ with American Medical Association (AMA)/Specialty Society RVS Update Committee (RUC) recommendations. The societies urge CMS to consider restoring the Refinement Panel process that served as an appeals process for those commenting on CMS proposed relative values.\\n Pediatrix opposes the addition of the G2211 new add-on code for complexity as they are concerned that the presence of the code would distort the current and established convention of how clinicians bill for complex patients. As an alternative to adopting the code, pursuing engagement with CPT and concurrent RUC evaluation would provide Medicare a foundation of broader professional acceptance and enhanced stakeholder clarity regarding Medicare's focus on encounter complexity.  The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) recommends that CMS revisit the policy on HCPCS code G2211. Given the impact to the conversion factor and payment to other providers, APTA recommends CMS not implement this code or at a minimum delay implementation until it can adequately respond to concerns.  The America Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) urges CMS to finalize add-on code G2211 as proposed. The AASLD urge CMS to provide guidance to physicians on the documentation requirements, including how often the code may be billed, and other information as required to make sure physicians are using this add-on code appropriately.\\n\\nAASLD also supports CMS' efforts to update the E/M code families, beginning with the outpatient family and culminating in the changes proposed to the inpatient and observation services, emergency department (ED) visits, nursing facility visits, domiciliary or rest home visits, home visits, and cognitive impairment assessment. AASLD supports creating a panel of physicians, patients, health economists, coders, health informaticists, and other stakeholders with expertise in payment policy. They believe a panel composed of individuals with areas of expertise will be able to look at E/M payment comprehensively to ensure these codes reflect the complex E/M work.  American Heart Association (AHA) supports the add on payment for longitudinal care for complex patients to ensure clinicians have the added resources necessary to adequately cover the costs of providing care The Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) requests that CMS not implement payment for HCPCS G2211, complexity add-on code to office/outpatient E/M visits. SIR instead requests that CMS institute an indefinite self-imposed moratorium for payment of this code. SIR also requests CMS find a more equitable solution to budget neutrality which does not require specialized care continuing to support budget shortfalls. The American Academy of Opthalmology (the Academy) stresses their continued disagreement with the CMS proposal to assign the \\u2018active\\u2019 status indicator to add-on code G2211 as of January 1, 2024. The Academy has expressed in the past that implementation of G2211 is contradictory to the reason for which the code was initially established.  The Academy feels CMS\\u2019s overall utilization estimates of 38 percent in 2024 and 54 percent once the code is fully adopted are overstated. The Academy has serious concerns about increasing the financial burden on Medicare beneficiaries. Though the budget neutrality adjustment for 2024 accounts for the impacts of G2211 utilization on net beneficiary out-of-pocket costs, it does not reflect the impact to Medicare patients individually. The Academy strongly urges CMS to abandon plans to implement G2211. At a minimum, the Academy respectfully asks that CMS revise the utilization assumptions for G2211 to mitigate the negative impact on the conversion factor for all Medicare providers.  The American College of Surgeons (ACS) strongly urges CMS not to implement G2211. If CMS does end up implementing G2211, ACS urges CMS to make a lower utilization assumption for the first year to mitigate the budget neutrality impact and allow additional time for assessing the true utilization of G2211. MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) asks for reconsideration of the proposal that G2211 is not expected to be billed for visits with modifier 25. In addition, they also recommend that CMS work more closely with the AMA to better align future reimbursement proposals with the AMA's CPT code sets. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) is deeply concerned about the impact of the new add-on code payment policy on their specialty, which is -1.0% based on CMS' impact tables. AAAAI urges CMS to either exempt the complexity add-on code from budget-neutral adjustments and provide clear coding and billing guidance, or eliminate the complexity add-on code altogether. The National Organization of Rheumatology Managers (NORM) appreciates, but has concerns about the impact of this add-on code on the CY 2024 conversion factor, which they feel is already unsustainably low. NORM feels CMS should re-estimate the use of this code to lower the budget neutrality adjustment. Additionally, NORM invites CMS to work with the organization on developing explicit billing and coding guidance to facilitate correct documentation by rheumatology practices and prevent misapplication of the code.  The North American Neuromodulation Society (NANS) has extensive concerns with CMS implementing G2211 visit complexity code and believes there is a lack of clarity on the purpose, use, and reporting of this code. NANS continues to have questions and concerns regarding the resources, typical patient, time, and definition, and reporting and monitoring of this visit complexity code. NANS continues to request that CMS delay implementation of the G2211 complex care code until these issues are clarified and resolved.  The Physician Fee Schedule Pathology Payment Coalition (PFS Coalition) asks CMS not to finalize the add on code G2211 given the impact and lack of need for this code in light of recent E/M changes.  The American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) continues to oppose implementation of HCPCS code G2211 to be used with existing evaluation & management (E/M) visits providing an add-on payment for complex patients. AAOS believes implementation of this code will negatively impact surgeons and patients. AAOS strongly urges CMS to indefinitely delay implementation of G2211. Implementing this unnecessary code may result in overpayments as well as penalize all physicians due to the reduction in the Medicare conversion factor which will be required to maintain budget neutrality under the Physician Fee Schedule. The American Society of Radiologic Technologists (ASRT) appreciates CMS revising the E/M add-on code utilization. However, they are concerned about its impact on physician payment and patient cost-sharing and ask the agency to further refine the utilization assumptions.\\n\\nASRT also supports the AMA RUC as the entity best positioned to provide recommendations to CMS on\\nresource inputs for work and PE valuations. The Advocacy Council and ACAAI encourage the agency to reconsider its utilization assumptions for HCPCS code G2211 in light of the ambiguity surrounding the circumstances under which providers may bill this code.  The Alliance for Physical Therapy Quality and Innovation (APTQI) notes that the G2211 code should not be implemented at a time when the fee schedule has not kept up with inflation. APTQI urges CMS to postpone implementing G2211 until the fee schedule is eligible for inflation adjustments. The American Society of Nephrology (ASN) welcomes CMS appreciation of longitudinal care of complex patients\\u2014a common denominator for nephrology patients. ASN is pleased to see that CMS has modified its estimates on the \\u201credistributive impacts\\u201d, but ASN will await final details on the actual amount paid on the add-on code and CMS\\u2019s final details on the plan for redistribution before supporting this step. ASN calls on CMS to vigorously monitor the use and impact of this code as well as provide robust information and outreach to clinicians about its proper use. The American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) appreciates CMS\\u2019 proposed reassessment of G2211 utilization. They urge CMS to reassess its utilization assumptions for G2211 and consider the impacts to beneficiaries in the form of cost-sharing.\\n\\nASE is concerned that CMS is soliciting feedback on how to establish E/M values and caution careful consideration of other resources such as those that rely only on time data and do not address other factors such as complexity and intensity, which are necessary components when determining the value of services and procedures. They urge CMS to consider restoring the Refinement Panel process that served as an appeals process for those commenting on CMS proposed relative values. Given the anticipated widespread applicability of this code and the proposed revisions for CY 2024 to restrict use of the add-on code when modifier 25 is present, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) urges CMS to provide clear guidance and education to clinicians ahead of CY 2024 to ensure appropriate coding. CMS should also carefully monitor utilization of this code to ensure that its estimates for budget-neutrality purposes are reasonably accurate. The California Medical Association (CMA) urges CMS to further reduce the utilization assumption on the new E/M add-on code G2211 consistent with the data provided by several medical organizations. CMS generally supports the new E/M add-on code G2211 to reflect the provision of more complex care of sicker patients needing more coordination among physician specialists. Vizient remains concerned that the potential impact of this proposed code may be disruptive and have variable impacts depending on the type of provider. While Vizient agrees that providers should be adequately reimbursed for the treatment of complex patients, the agency states that this code will primarily be used in primary care, and the agency does not anticipate the use of this code in specialties without longitudinal patient relationships, such as surgical specialties. To minimize disruption, Vizient encourages CMS to refrain from implementing a budget neutrality adjustment for CY 2024, especially as actual utilization of this code remains to be seen. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) supports the reintroduction of the outpatient office code, but advocates for a comprehensive reform of the Medicare reimbursement program to allow for more accurate representation of medical decision-making.  The American Society of Hematology (ASH) thanks CMS for proposing to reimburse providers for the complexity add-on code G2211, and agrees that the code reflects the time, intensity, and practice expense (PE) resources involved when practitioners furnish the kinds of E/M office visit services that enable them to build longitudinal patient relationships.\\n\\nASH also provides feedback related to CMS's request for comment about evaluating E&M services more regularly and comprehensively.  The Society of General Internal Medicine (SGIM) urges CMS to implement the complexity add-on code G2211 as proposed. G2211 is necessary to support the resources required to maintain continuous patient care. As internal medicine specialists practicing primary care, SGIM members are aware of the resources required to maintain access between a patient and a physician between visits. Providing payment for G2211 reflects the resources required to support longitudinal care outside of the time spent and services provided on the calendar day of a face-to-face visit beyond what is captured by the current E/ M service codes and, most importantly, the infrastructure required to maintain a continuous relationship with each individual patient. The Coalition of State Rheumatology Organizations (CSRO) appreciates the intent behind this new code and welcomes additional reimbursement for the longitudinal care provided to patients with complex, chronic rheumatologic diseases. CSRO believe the care it provides has largely been undervalued under the current E/M service codes, as it fails to account for its expertise and additional training as a cognitive specialty. Moreover, CMS no longer pays for consultation codes, despite the increased work that is involved in delivering this service. CSRO states that CMS should consider these sentiments as part of its request for comment on more regular and comprehensive reviews of E/M services. The American Optometric Association (AOA) opposes implementation of the G2211 add-on code. AOA is  concerned there will be confusion regarding the appropriate use of this code and believe that it\\u2019s critical for CMS and Congress to address the flaws in the Medicare payment system, rather than develop new coding that benefit only certain provider types. Movement is Life (MIL) supports CMS' proposal to introduce add-on code G2211. They believe this code will enhance care management for patients, improving care outcomes and patient satisfaction. However, MIL suggests that Medicare should expand care management coverage for specialty providers, recognizing that specialists often play a significant role in managing a patient's condition, even if the patient initially consults a specialist without involving a primary care provider. They advocate for acknowledging the involvement of specialists in patient care management in future coverage policies for care management. American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation agrees that delivery of longitudinal care increases time, intensity, and practice expense involved in managing patients\\u2019 care and that G2211 holds promise for more accurately reimbursing. Thus, American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation urges CMS to provide more guidance to help physicians and other billing practitioners better understand the conditions under which use of the code is appropriate. In addition, American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation urges CMS to reduce utilization management assumptions for G2211.  The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) agrees with CMS that this add-on payment would improve the accuracy of payment for primary and longitudinal care. APhA asks CMS to specifically recognize \\\"pharmacists\\\" and any related pharmacist-provided patient care service utilized in this context. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) believes the utilization estimates are wildly high and, at a minimum, CMS should revisit these estimates. ASPS notes CMS could avoid the drastic 2024 budget neutrality adjustment by simply rescinding its proposal to begin paying for G2221, and is currently the most significant opportunity before CMS.  The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) believes G2211 remains duplicative of work already accounted for by existing codes and, if implemented, it will inappropriately result in overpayments to those using it because the appropriate use is not well defined. ASA strongly urges CMS not to implement code G2211. The National Association of ACOs (NAACOS) appreciates CMS' recognition of the complexity in delivering primary care and supports the implementation of HCPCS code G2211. The American Academy of Home Care Medicine (Academy) or (AAHCM) appreciates CMS\\u2019 efforts to ensure proper reimbursement for complex patient care, and agrees with CMS that there is a need for the G2211 code. Given the importance of this code, the Academy strongly opposes the exclusion of HBPC providers from billing the office/ outpatient (O/O) E/M visit complexity add-on code. The reduced conversion factor will reduce already low reimbursement for a broad array of providers, including HBPC providers caring for the sickest, most complex and expensive patients. The Academy is concerned that the omission of home care providers from billing the complexity add-on code disregards the essential role home care providers play in addressing the health care needs of the sickest Medicare patients and reflects a lack of recognition of the overall value of home-based medical care in terms of patients, caregivers, and payers. \\n\\nThe Academy also provides feedback on how CMS might evaluate E/M Services more regularly and comprehensively.  The Endocrine Society is pleased to see that Medicare will finally reimburse for the G2211 code and recommends that CMS finalize payment. The Endocrine Society also thanks CMS for revising the add-on code's utilization assumptions and providing more detailed information on how this service can be billed. However, the Endocrine Society suggests that the agency provide further guidance as to the documentation requirements, how often the code may be billed, and other guidance that may be helpful to ensure that the code is being used in the manner for which it was intended. The Endocrine Society also responds to CMS' request for comments regarding evaluating E/M services more regularly and comprehensively.  The Emergency Department Practice Management Association (EDPMA) opposes the introduction of and payment for G2211 because it is poorly defined and will create confusion about how and when it is appropriate to bill and is likely described by already existing care management services. The American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) and the Outpatient Ophthalmic Surgery Society (OOSS) urge CMS to eliminate the complexity add-on code (HCPCS code G2211) that is responsible for more than half of the estimated reduction to the CY 2024 PFS conversion factor because they find it unnecessary and inappropriate. They believe that all physicians, including those the add-on code and associated payment aims to assist, face difficulty in the current fiscal climate, so policies that unnecessarily and inappropriately reduce the conversion factor must be avoided.\\n\\nThe American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) urges CMS to apply the increased E/M values as finalized in the CY 2021 PFS to the post-operative E/M visits in 10- and 90-day global surgical procedure codes. They claim that CMS\\u2019 policy runs counter to the law/precedent and that CMS should comply with the law and increase the value of post-operative E/M visits included in global surgery bundles to be equal to the value of standalone E/M services. \\n\\nWith regard to the request for comment about evaluating E/M services more regularly, the commenters disagree that a separate \\u201cpanel\\u201d is needed to value E/M and similar services beyond the processes convened by the AMA, where CMS and primary care specialties actively participate, and those that CMS undertakes on its own. They claim that any effort to duplicate the AMA RUC process solely for the purpose of valuing E/M services would be a misuse of taxpayer funds that Congress appropriates to CMS each year to administer the Medicare program. We strongly oppose the establishment of a duplicative process to the AMA CPT and RUC for valuing E/M and other primary care services. The American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) urges CMS to rescind its proposal to implement reimbursement in CY 2024 for G2211 and to withdraw G2211 as a reportable, payable code and to make no further proposals regarding payment for G2211 in future rulemaking. The National Association of Rehabilitation Providers and Agencies (NARA) supports the comments and findings submitted by the AMA on August 14, 2023 on this topic and requests that CMS put a moratorium on the implementation of G2211. NARA believes the G2211 code is duplicative of work already described in other CPT codes.  The American Association of Clinical Urologists (AACU) would like to commend CMS on its policy recommendations regarding the G2211 complex care add-on code and requests further details around the indications and required documents for this code.  The American Osteopathic Association (AOA) appreciates CMS's efforts to support payment for E/M services, but have several concerns. They call for greater clarity on when G2211 should be reported, question CMS's assumptions about the code's utilization and its impact on budget neutrality, and feel CMS' estimates are overly optimistic. They believe that the initial adoption rates projected by CMS are unlikely to be realized without clear guidance and concerted educational efforts.\\n\\nThe American Osteopathic Association (AOA) believes that the current HCPCS codes for Evaluation and Management (E/M) services effectively define the full range of these services, albeit with some concerns about Medicare payment reflecting the total cost of physician activities. Regarding the entity best suited to provide recommendations for resource inputs and service valuations, AOA strongly supports the American Medical Association's Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC), feeling the RUC is uniquely capable of accurately evaluating service values and no other entity can match its expertise and breadth of specialty input. The Federation of American Hospitals (FAH) believes in the intent of this proposal but are concerned about ensuring clarity around the new policy. As such, FAH urges CMS to actively monitor the G2211 code and course correct as necessary, to ensure usage of the code is meeting the intent of the policy without redistributive affects that would affect patient access to care across all specialties. American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) does not object to the creation of evaluation and management (E/M) add-on code for complex patients. However, as ASHP has previously stated to the agency, ASHP remain concerned that CMS\\u2019s payment policy for evaluation and management (E/M) coding for pharmacist-provided incident-to services threatens patient access to vital services such as comprehensive medication management (CMM) and chronic disease management.\\n\\nLimiting coding for incident-to services ignores the essential role pharmacists play in treating patients in the ambulatory care space and the value and expertise they provide to their healthcare teams. Pharmacists\\u2019 expertise is critical to quality patient care. Kidney Care Partners (KCP) supports the proposal to adopt a separate add-on payment for HCPCS code G2211. They urge CMS to finalize the complexity add-on and support its use for individuals with Chronic Kidney Disease. The Adventist Health Policy Association (AHPA) recommends that CMS delay the implementation of this complexity add-on code G2211. While AHPA appreciates that CMS is trying to better compensate providers for the work they do managing complex medical needs, the budget neutral mandate will only shift the issue of low compensation to other provider types. Increasing payment to a select group of providers at the expense of others is short sighted and will ultimately restrict access to care. Last year, CMS also stated its intent to tie 100% of reimbursements to value-based contracts by 2030. This means that by 2030, most Medicare beneficiaries would be receiving care through an alternative payment model in which payments are already risk-adjusted for complex patients. The American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) appreciates that CMS has revised its assessment of this policy\\u2019s impact on the conversion factor. However, The American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) encourages CMS to further reevaluate those assumptions to align with experience with newly introduced coding for services.\\n\\nBy paying clinicians for providing this highly effective, low-cost care, G2211 will help improve patient and population health outcomes and strengthen the Medicare program.  The American Speech Language Hearing Association (ASHA) urges CMS to stop implementation of G2211. National Rural Health Association (NRHA) believes that rural primary care physicians will benefit from using G2211 and enhance access for rural beneficiaries.  The American College of Mohs Surgery (ACMS) urges CMS to eliminate its policy to pay for a previously finalized \\\"complexity add-on code\\\" as it is inappropriate and unnecessary. \\n American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) strongly opposes CMS\\u2019 proposal to now implement the add-on code, G2211 and urge CMS not to implement G2211.\\n\\nThe original rationale for the add-on code was based on CMS\\u2019 policy for a single payment rate for office/outpatient E/M visit levels 2 through 5, which was rescinded in 2021. Payment for code G2211 is not justified because under the new\\ncoding structure, physicians, and qualified health care professionals (QHPs) have the flexibility to bill a higher-level E/M code to account for increased patient complexity or a higher-level code based on total time, which includes non-face-to-face time, even if the encounter itself was not complex.\\n\\nIf implemented, this code will inappropriately result in overpayments to those using it while at the same time\\npenalizing all physicians with the reduced conversion factor required to maintain budget neutrality. Although in the\\nproposed rule CMS somewhat mitigated the cut's impact on the conversion factor by estimating lower utilization\\nassumptions for implementing G2211, CMS also states that approximately 90 percent of the budget neutrality\\nadjustment for CY 2024 is attributable to G2211. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) is still very unclear on the requirements for the service and whether interventional cardiologists would be\\nable to use the code. Clarification of documentation requirements is necessary to fully understand the code\\u2019s intended use and properly estimate its utilization. \\n\\nAs interventional cardiologists bill a large number of procedures, SCAI has concerns about the negative impact of the budget neutrality reductions on the specialty, especially given the ambiguous description of G2211 and our inability to determine if interventional cardiologists will receive any benefit from being able to bill the code. The Partnership to Empower Physician-Led Care (PEPC) urges CMS to finalize the proposal to implement HCPCS code G2211. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) fully supports the HCPCS add-on code G2211 and suggests CMS produce educational materials for participating providers designed to clarify appropriate usage of the code.  The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) notes G2211 is unnecessary and duplicative of previously completed code revaluation(s) designed to recognize complexity. The SVS urges CMS to delete HCPCS Code G2211 prior to the scheduled 1/1/2024 implementation.\\n\\nSVS urges CMS to continue to work with the AMA\\u2019s RUC to establish relative value units for the Medicare physician fee schedule. The SVS requests more timely access to Medicare and Medicaid data. Finally, SVS encourages CMS to address issues that involve a limited number of providers directly with those providers and to avoid creating far-reaching policy changes that impact an entire specialty or group of related specialties Kaiser Permanente supports CMS' proposal to make HCPCS code G2211 separately payable but recommends CMS also allow for G2211 to be payable when the O/O E/M visit is reported with payment modifier 25. Kaiser Permanente also suggests CMS provide more specific instructions for the use of G2211.  The Alliance of Specialty Medicine is concerned that creating a second process focused exclusively on establishing E/M service values would be duplicative and derive lower RVUs for physician services. CMS is already engaged in the AMA RUC process, and they ask that staff who attend be forthright about concerns with physician service values as they are being evaluated during the RUC meetings rather than using separate processes established by the agency. The AMA appreciates CMS' proposed reassessment of G2211 utilization in 2024 in response to AMA advocacy, but nonetheless strongly echoes the concerns raised by various stakeholders regarding the new utilization assumptions. The AMA believes that the lack of clarity surrounding the appropriate circumstances for reporting this code, combined with potential implications for patient cost-sharing has created significant ambiguity among health care practitioners. The AMA also responds to CMS' solicitations regarding evaluating E/M services more regularly and comprehensively. CMS notes that approximately 90 percent of the -2.17 percent budget neutrality adjustment is attributable to G2211.\\n\\nWithout further clarity, physicians will be less likely to report this code, and it calls into serious question CMS\\u2019s assumption that more than one-in-three office visits will include this add-on code in 2024.\\n The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) support CMS\\u2019 proposal to create and implement an add-on G-code to better recognize and reimburse for physicians caring for Medicare beneficiaries with complex chronic conditions. ATS and CHEST urge CMS to move forward with the proposed G-code in the 2024 Final Rule. The American Medical Group Association (AGMA) appreciates CMS\\u2019 recognition of the increased costs posed by complex cases during E/M visits. AMGA is concerned the add-on code (G2211) will lead to additional across-the-board cuts, which illustrate the flaws inherent to the physician fee schedule\\u2019s budget neutrality requirements. The American Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) disagrees with the implementation of G2211 sue to its lack of clarity, duplicative nature, and negative impact on the conversion factor for 2024.  The American Association of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commends that implementation of G2211 be delayed further until CMS can provide clear, concise instructions on when it is appropriate to use this code. Additionally, given the confusing nature of the code and associated guidance, they suggest the AMA revisit the estimated utilization upon initial implementation.\\n\\nThe AASM strongly believes that the methods used by the RUC and CMS are appropriate to accurately value E/M and other HCPCS codes, as they work with the RUC and many other societies to implement the survey process and revisit practice expense values on a regular basis, to provide recommended values to CMS. They suggest that the CMS consider restoring the Refinement Panel\\nprocess to employ a formal appeals process for stakeholders commenting on CMS proposed relative values. Association of American Medical Colleges (the AAMC) emphasizes the significant impact of implementing code G2211 and suggests that CMS offer clearer insights into how the utilization assumptions for this code were determined. They also recommend providing detailed education and guidance to practitioners on when to use this code and the necessary documentation for payment support. Additionally, the AAMC advises against applying budget neutrality to G2211, as it represents a new service not previously covered by Medicare. The Renal Physicians Association (RPA) supports implementation of the proposed complexity adjuster on January 1, 2024, and believes CMS\\u2019 utilization estimates are reasonable The Ambulatory Surgery Center Association urges CMS to not implement G2211 as the code lacks clarity on its purpose, use, and reporting, and the fact that 90 percent of the harmful budget neutrality adjustment to the CY 2024 CF can be attributed to G2211, there can be no reasonable rationale for moving forward with implementation.  The American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM) continues to support CMS\\u2019 proposed coverage and separate payment for the inherent complexity add-on code, G2211. However, AAHPM requests that CMS clarify palliative care practitioners may bill the complexity add-on code, even in such cases where their engagement with a patient may be discrete or time-limited in nature, given the focus on a patient\\u2019s single, serious condition or complex condition. AAHPM encourages CMS to continue to identify opportunities for improvement in coding and valuation, and then to work with the physician community via the CPT and RUC processes to refine final policies. The Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) remains opposed to the implementation of G2211 given the large cut it would make to electrophysiology services, many of which we continue to believe are already undervalued. HRS urges CMS to\\nrescind G2211. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) is concerned with the forced implementation of HCPCS add-on code G2211 when an existing, validated, reliable E/M coding payment exists. ACOG is concerned about the consequences of this code on the payment rate for physicians while not working towards the goal of improving access to primary care and preventive services, and thus recommends not finalizing the implementation of this code for CY 2024. ACOG responds to CMS' comment solicitation regarding the RUC and strongly urges CMS to continue to work with the AMA's RUC to establish RVUs for the Medicare PFS.  CVS Health supports CMS\\u2019 addition of the Office/Outpatient E/M Visit Complexity Add-On code to support the management of serious or complex conditions with a provider who maintains an ongoing relationship with the patient. CVS Health recommends CMS define what is considered a serious or complex condition for purposes of the add-on code for primary care and longitudinal care services to alleviate administrative burden and avoid creating confusion among stakeholders. CVS Health also recommends CMS define the term \\u201cserious or complex condition.\\u201d They believe CMS should also clearly indicate that for purposes of code G2211, the billing practitioner is required to take responsibility of ongoing medical management of the serious or complex condition and provide guidance on how this should be documented.  While the American Hospital Association (AHA) directionally supports adjustments to reimbursement to account for clinical complexity, the AHA is concerned about the redistributive impact of this particular code (G2211) and impact on the conversion factor in outyears. The American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) opposes the payment proposal for HCPCS G2211 to be payable on January 1, 2024. AOTA strongly urges CMS to delay provision of the O/O E/M inherent complexity add-on code for another year to prevent additional harmful cuts to therapy reimbursement that would further limit beneficiary access to high quality occupational therapy services.\\n\\nAOTA supports the existing AMA RVS Update Committee (RUC) recommendation process for valuation of E/M and other professional medical services. They believe there is no other entity with as robust a process as occurs within the AMA RUC meetings to value, review, and revalue CPT codes as necessary to ensure that code values accurately reflect the intensity, time, and cost of providing medically necessary physician and qualified health professional services. America\\u2019s Physician Group (APG) recommends that CMS finalize an add-on payment for HCPCS code G2211 to better recognize the resource costs associated with E&M visits for primary care and longitudinal care of complex patients. APG further recommends that CMS monitor the impact of this payment add-on, and seek opportunities to mitigate the redistributive effect within the Physician Fee Schedule. The Radiology Business Management Association (RBMA) is very concerned that utilization of G2211 in 2024 will drive very significant future reductions in the conversion factor, which will make radiology services to Medicare beneficiaries increasingly unsustainable. The RBMA urges CMS not to proceed with implementation of G2211. The RBMA also urges CMS to issue clear and well-defined guidance on its use, including detailed documentation requirements, correct coding guidance with respect to other codes describing the same services, and clinical examples of appropriate and inappropriate use. The RBMA urges CMS to immediately\\nannounce and implement a robust focused auditing program to discourage misuse of the code. The Alliance for Patient Access (AfPA) indicates that the new add-on\\npayment under HCPCS will ensure that clinicians are properly compensated for these visits, ensuring continued patient access. AfPA supports these new add-on payments.\\n The US Oncology Network (The Network) supports CMS\\u2019 proposal to move forward with implementation of G2211 for CY 2024. The Network encourages CMS to consider allowing use of this complexity-code for codes that have an E/M component but don\\u2019t bill for E/M separately. The Network notes that G2211 does not increase reimbursement for global services, including global surgical codes or radiation treatment management, even though these specialties are providing cancer care to the same complex patients and E/M services are a component of these bundles. The Network encourages CMS to consider allowing use of this complexity-code for codes that have an E/M component but don\\u2019t bill for E/M separately. Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance (MITA) suggests not implementing HCPCS code G2211 or phasing in its impact over four years, as the associated budget neutrality offset is a substantial contributor to the proposed reduction in the CY 2024 PFS conversion factor. The Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) appreciates that the agency has limited the application of G2211 and revised utilization assumptions; however, SGO has been and continues to be opposed to implementation and payment for G2211.\\n\\nSGO supports the work of the AMA and RUC and believes it is the entity best situated to value physician services.  The College of American Pathologists (CAP) urges CMS to discard payment of G2211 as the work is already described and accounted for within the existing E/M CPT code set. Implementation of G2211 would essentially mandate duplicate billing.\\n\\nThe CAP stands in full support of the RUC process. There is no need for another independent entity to provide recommendations regarding the valuation for services that are reported on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. Mental Health America (MHA) supports CMS\\u2019s decision to reinstate the add-on codes because additional resources for complex conditions, such as co-occurring physical and behavioral health needs, will provide additional support for providing integrated and coordinated mental health and substance use care in primary care. MHA supports combining the add-on code with increased valuation of the integrated care codes to fully incentivize and compensate integrated behavioral healthcare. The American College of Physicians (ACP) strongly supports CMS' proposal to implement the Medicare billing code, G2211. ACP believes G2211 will help promote beneficiaries' timely access to primary care and other continuous services that promote better health and reduce spending, and will also advance more appropriate payments for primary care and other longitudinal continuous care under the Medicare PFS. ACP is confident that G2211 will help in capturing the added complexity of primary care O/O visits. ACP is pleased that CMS refined the utilization estimates for G2211 and further offers that CMS consider making the add-on code G2211 incident to a physician's service. ACP also responds to CMS' request for information about evaluating E/M services more regularly and comprehensively.  The UnitedHealth Group (UHG) supports the addition of the new add on code for complex patients, G2211. UHC believes the phrase \\u201cgeneral framework of the O/O E/M visits\\u201d provides little insight into CMS\\u2019s intentions. UHG believes disagreement amongst stakeholders over various CPT interpretations could be substantially reduced with guidance from CMS clarifying CPT E/M Code and Guideline Changes, effective January 1, 2023: Table 1: Levels of Medical Decision Making (MDM). The Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) and American College of Nuclear Medicine (ACNM) appreciate that CMS revised their understanding of how often the E/M add-on code G2211 will be reported and reduced the utilization assumptions.  The Community Oncology Alliance is concerned that the separate add-on payment for HCPCS code G2211 will undermine cancer patient care when accounting for associated conversion factor reduction costs for oncology physicians. In addition, the Alliance requests CMS to implement the CY 2024 budget neutrality adjustment on a longer timeline to provide practices with additional time to prepare for changes.  Medical Group Management Association (MGMA) encourages CMS to provide further clarity and guidance surrounding the utilization of HCPCS code G2211. For CMS to properly implement this code, MGMA asks the agency to further refine its utilization assumption, clarify ongoing questions surrounding utilization of the code, and share robust guidance with the provider community. The Association for Clinical Oncology (ASCO)  supports implementation of the new code for complexity, G2211; however, ASCO urges CMS to provide additional billing and coding guidance and a clear definition of \\u201ccomplex\\u201d so clinicians know when it would be appropriate to bill the new add-on code for complexity. We also ask CMS to revise the utilization assumption for this code. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) appreciates and supports CMS' proposal to implement the new G2211 add-on code. The ADA also supports the revisions that CMS is making to the code, but believes that the utilization assumptions in this rule may still be too high.  The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) urges CMS to finalize implementation of G2211 effective January 1, 2024 for office-based primary care and encourages CMS to extend its use to home-based primary care services that meet the requirements of the code. \\n\\nAdditionally, AGS asks CMS to consider allowing G2211 for the Home/Residence services codes. AGS also urges CMS to finalize the proposal that G2211 cannot be billed with E/M services reported with modifier -25, unless the other services is a preventative service. Generally, AGS asks that CMS further evaluate the expected usage of the G2211 code. \\n\\nAGS recommends against efforts to value E/M services more frequently or under a different administrative\\nprocess would likely create additional burden on the physicians who furnish those service.  American College of Radiation Oncology (ACRO) does not support the implementation of G2211 and requests that its implementation be temporarily frozen and believes it runs counter to CMS's priorities in stability and predictability.  Michigan State Medical Society (MSMS) appreciates the attempt to mitigate the impact of this add-on code is expected to have on the conversion factor. However, MSMS remains concerned about any policy change that results in reimbursements cuts. Therefore, MSMS concurs with the American Medical Association\\u2019s (AMA) request to further refine utilization assumptions for G2211 to \\u201cavert an unwarranted permanent reduction to the conversion factor.\\u201d  Consumers First supports CMS' proposal to implement the G2211 code and encourages CMS to build on the proposal by ensuring payment rates reflect the nature of primary care visits and the increasing practice costs. \\n\\nConsumers First also encourages CMS to incentivize participation in models centered on primary care to help clinicians move to population-based models.  The American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) urges CMS to not implement G2211, given the continued ambiguity of how the code should be used, who can use the code, the overlap with current CPT E/M codes, and the across-the-board reduction in the conversion factor for all physician and QHPs. The American Academy of Dermatology Association (AADA) strongly opposes the implementation of HCPCS add-on code G2211. The AADA maintains that the definition and usage of G2211 are ambiguous, undermining the relativity of resource-based relative value units (RVUs). The AADA believes is unreasonable and discriminatory that the code cannot be billed with modifier 25.  While the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) supports CMS\\u2019 proposal to implement G2211 in 2024, ASAM also directs CMS to comments from the AMA RUC, which has previously outlined various concerns with CMS regarding implementing this code. ASAM encourages CMS to define and value, appropriately, and provide information on the appropriate use of, this proposed code. American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) supports the implementation of the G2211 code. AARP, however, urges CMS to waive cost-sharing for this E/M add-on code as Medicare beneficiaries should not be subjected to coinsurance for services that happen behind the scenes or without their direct initiation and involvement.  Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) supports CMS paying for add-on code G2211 for complex E&M visits, with clarification that education/discussion of alternative treatment options for pain is appropriate for add-on payment. BIO supports the goal of developing and paying for this service to address patient needs with consistency and continuity over long periods of time, with the understanding that the payment is for the time, intensity, and practice expense of providing these services to patients. The Large Urology Group Practice Association (LUGPA) supports the finalization of G2211, but recommends CMS consider permitting the use of the -25 modifier in the situations where the surgical code is associated with a 0-day global period and where the usual site of service is an O/O setting. As an alternative, LUGPA suggests that CPT codes 52000 and 51741 be exempt from the -25 modifier exclusion so that urologists may continue to perform these tests and be appropriately reimbursed for the simultaneous provision of longitudinal care.  The American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) asks that CMS not change the status indicator for G2211 to \\u201cactive\\u201d and not begin payment for this service because:\\n\\n\\u2022 Instituting payment for G2211 will introduce disruptions to the resource-based relative value units (RVUs) under the Physician Fee Schedule.\\n\\u2022 A laborious effort was undertaken by the AMA CPT Editorial Panel to modify the evaluation and management (E&M) code set, with these changes then accepted by CMS. These changes modify and modernize the E&M code set, allowing practitioners to adequately represent the complexity of services they provide. Instituting payment for G2211 compromises the progress made and will cause confusion among practitioners.\\n\\u2022 G2211 will unfairly impact practitioners who may not be\\nable to utilize the code due to the need to maintain budget neutrality. Utilization is expected to vary significantly based on specialty and individual practitioners\\u2019 practice patterns, with only a fraction of specialties likely to be able to fully recoup the reduction based on G2211 billing. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) generally supports the use of the G2211 visit complexity code.\\n\\n\\nThe APA encourages CMS to develop and publicize a process for data submission as well as provide examples of the types of data to be considered to inform better evidence-based and more accurate payments for E/M and other services. Additionally, the APA supports ongoing reductions in administrative burdens associated with data collection and notes it may be worthwhile for CMS to explore how technology can support data collection activities. Finally, the APA notes that recommendations from the RUC should be considered along with any supplemental data presented from interested stakeholders when establishing values for E/M and other services.  The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) urges CMS to reconsider its proposal and not go forward with the new G-code because of the unnecessary nature of the code, the lack of clarity around when to bill the code, and the failure of CMS to go through the formal Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) process for the code.\\n\\nACEP supports the current fair and balanced American Medical Association (AMA) Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC) process and is opposed to making changes that could distort the value of codes under the fee schedule. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) appreciated CMS' intent to ensure physicians are adequately paid for patients that are outliers but believe the G2211 add-on code needs to be better defined to reduce redundancy and confusion. Thus, the ACC suggests CMS delay the implementation of G2211, more clearly define its purpose and usage, and reduce estimated utilization.\\n\\nThe ACC believes existing E/M codes accurately define the range of E/M services as understood today. The ACC also believes the process established by the RUC to provide recommendations to CMS is appropriate. The ACC believes the CPT Editorial Panel accurately defines current Non-E/M HCPCS codes, but the applicability of the codes is limited in some instances. If HCRCS codes are not accurately defines, problems with billing and compliance will evolve. Incorrectly valued services distort relativity in the fee schedule and inaccurately shift resources. \\n The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) supports proposals to establish a technical expert panel that would advise CMS on a data-driven approach to adequately value E/M codes, and offers the following responses:\\n\\na. Do the existing E/M HCPCS codes accurately define the full range of E/M services with appropriate gradations for intensity of services?\\nThe current set of E/M codes do not accurately identify and value what is provided by an ID clinician during a consultation. To address this, CMS should restore \\u201cactive\\u201d status to consultations and establish values that are commensurate with the time and expertise ID clinicians provide when delivering these services.\\n\\n\\nb. Are the methods used by the RUC and CMS appropriate to accurately value E/M and other HCPCS codes?\\nCurrent values for E/M codes, particularly inpatient, are far too low to accurately capture the value of services provided, and the methods must be improved. In particular, current approaches have no adequate way to measure the complexity of care delivered or the value of a clinician\\u2019s expertise.\\n\\ne. What are the consequences if services described by HCPCS codes are not accurately defined?\\nConfusion about when and how to use HCPCS codes can lead to clinicians  and administrative staff inadvertently misusing or misapplying a HCPCS code, leaving them vulnerable to program integrity audits. To mitigate this risk and increase beneficiary access to services codes, code\\ndescriptors should be clear and understandable, and billing and coding guidelines should be established across a range of clinician types.\\n\\nf. What are the consequences if services described by HCPCS codes are not accurately valued?\\nPoorly defined and undervalued services lead to uncompensated clinically intense E/M patient care. Inadequate reimbursement is a chief driver of workforce shortages. If there are significant workforce deficiencies, as is the case with the ID field, achieving equitable access to high quality care will be impossible. In fact, lack of a sufficient ID workforce is already contributing to inequitable outcomes for serious infections, as we have seen with COVID-19 The American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA Pain Medicine) urges CMS to delay the implementation of code G2211 until the many concerns raised about this code are addressed. ASRA Pain Medicine is committed to evidence-based therapies that support caring for patients with acute and chronic conditions and notes more consideration and analysis of the services associated with code G2211 are needed, and this code should not be implemented until they\\nare resolved. The American Psychological Association (APA) joins with other primary care organizations in supporting CMS\\u2019 proposal to implement HCPCS add-on code G2211 in 2024. Additionally, the APA urges CMS to further refine its utilization assumptions for G2211 to avert an unwarranted permanent reduction to the conversion factor. APTA Private Practice strongly recommends that CMS revisit its policy on the HCPCS code G2211. They believe CMS should delay implementation of this code until it can adequately respond to these concerns. The American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) supports the proposal to change the status of HCPCS code G2211 to make it separately payable by assigning the \\u201cactive\\u201d status indicator, effective January 1, 2024. The AANP also provides comment about evaluating E/M services more regularly and comprehensively, consideration of valuation changes to other codes similar to the approach in section II.J.5. of the rule, and whether current AMA RUC is the entity that is best positioned to provide recommendations to CMS.  The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) opposes the implementation of HCPCS add-on code G2211, which is proposed by CMS for separate payment of office/outpatient E/M visits starting on January 1, 2024. STS argues that G2211 lacks justification because the new E/M coding structure already allows flexibility in billing higher-level codes to account for complexity and time. Additionally, they contend that G2211 is duplicative as there are existing validated codes for various complexity levels and continuing care. \\n\\nSTS raises concerns about the code not being resource-based, potentially leading to payment reductions for physicians and disrupting resource-based RVUs for E/M services. They strongly oppose the implementation of G2211, stating that it is no longer justified and could harm physician practices, affecting their ability to deliver quality care to patients. The Dialysis Vascular Access Coalition (DVAC) believe it would be best for CMS to truly \\u201cprioritize stability and predictability over ongoing updates\\u201d by temporarily freezing the implementation of further policy updates, including the implementation of G2211 in 2024 \\u2013 that will result in further cuts to dialysis vascular access centers. The Massachusetts Medical Society (MMS) agrees that the utilization assumption should be even further reduced until there is further clarity on the appropriate use of the code and to prevent further unwarranted budget neutrality reductions. MMS urges CMS to further refine these assumptions to prevent unwarranted reductions in the Medicare conversion factor. MMS also supports the new E/M Add-on Code G2211 to reflect the provision of more complex care of sicker patients needing more coordination among physician specialists. The Primary Care Collaborative (PCC) and PCC\\u2019s Better Health \\u2013 NOW campaign (the Campaign) believes it is essential CMS continues to refine the Medicare fee schedule in ways that support comprehensive, longitudinal and team-based primary care. PCC/the Campaign supports the implementation of the proposed G2211 inherently complex care add-on code. PCC/the Campaign encourage CMS to further reevaluate those assumptions to align with experience with coding for newly introduced services.  The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) do not support the agency\\u2019s proposed add-on code to O/O E&M visits because there continues to be too much ambiguity regarding the code\\u2019s use and the costs it is intended to cover. If CMS decides to implement the add-on code, MedPAC encourages the agency to add further clarifications or claim edits to help prevent underuse or overuse. \\n\\nIn addition to comments on the add-on complexity, MedPAC provides several approaches for improving the accuracy of RVUs. The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine supports CMS' proposal to implement the Medicare billing code G2211, but wants to point out that it is not billable for the most complex population in the nursing facility setting. The Society urges CMS to continue to strengthen primary care services performed in this setting given the shortage of physicians and APPs practicing in this space.  The Outpatient Endovascular and Interventional Society (OEIS) suggest that CMS freeze the implementation of the G2211 add-on.  The American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) appreciates that CMS reduced its estimated utilization assumption for G2211 but because CMS states there are \\\"many visits\\\" with new or established patients where the code would not be appropriately reported, ASNC asks CMS to reevaluate its utilization estimates and recommends that CMS include an examination of actual utilization of similar codes implemented in recent years, such as chronic care management and transitional care management services. ASNC responds to CMS' request for comment about evaluating E/M services more regularly and comprehensively. ASNC believes the AMA RUC should remain the principle vehicle for refining the work and practice expense components of the resource-based relative value scale. One improvement that CMS should consider, however, is restoring the Refinement Panel process.  The American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) agrees with the AMA resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS) Update Committee (RUC) that the code lacks clarity on its purpose and reporting, and ASCP urges CMS to abandon G2211 as the code provides duplicative payment.\\n\\nASCP believes that the methods used by the AMA RUC and CMS are appropriate to accurately value E/M and other HCPCS codes. Additionally, as signers of the 2016 letter, ASCP again urges CMS to reinstate the Refinement Panel process. Envision Healthcare urges CMS not to implement code G2211 for 2024. At a minimum, Envision Healthcare suggests that CMS should further revise its utilization assumptions to further mitigate the budget neutrality adjustment to the conversion factor based on the adoption of this code.\\n\\nG2211 remains duplicative of work already accounted for by existing codes and, if implemented, will inappropriately distort the current structure for complex patients, which is largely already part of the E/M coding structure. \\n\\nG-codes can also create additional complexity across different payers. Private payers and other payers outside of traditional Medicare often will not cover and equally reimburse for these codes. This creates inconsistencies across payers and the coding system, which should not be the goal of CMS policy. The International Pain and Spine Intervention Society  strongly recommend that the agency make additional adjustments to its utilization assumption to better account for the considerable uncertainty surrounding the appropriate use of this code and to avert an unwarranted permanent reduction to the Medicare conversion factor. The International Society for the Advancement of Spine Surgery (ISASS) continues to have questions and concerns regarding the resources, typical patient, time, and definition, and reporting and monitoring of this visit complexity code. concerned that the typical patient to receive G2211 services is not well defined. ISASS continues to request that CMS delay implementation of the G2211 complex care code until such time as these issues are clarified and resolved.\",\n          \"Premier Inc. applauds CMS' provision to establish Medicare Part B coverage for services billed by marriage and family therapists (MFTs) and mental health counselors (MHCs). Premier Inc. also applauds CMS' provision to allow addiction counselors to enroll as MHCs. The Primary Care Development Corporation (PCDC) strongly supports integration of primary care and behavioral health services, PCDC urges CMS to approve the proposal to implement Section 4121 of the CAA 2023, which provides for Medicare Part B coverage and payment under the PFS for the services of MFTs and MHCs, and the proposal to increase the valuation for timed behavioral health services The American Academy of Family Physicians supports this proposal and appreciates CMS\\u2019 work to improve access to behavioral health care.  The American Counseling Association (ACA) appreciates CMS\\u2019 proposed post-graduate clinical supervision requirements for MHCs to be eligible to enroll in Medicare. In particular, CMS proposes that MHCs perform at least two years or 3,000 hours of post-master\\u2019s degree clinical supervised experience in an appropriate\\nsetting, such as a hospital, Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF), private practice, or clinic, \\u201cif consistent with State licensure requirements.\\u201d They appreciate the proposed flexibility and agree that 3,000 hours is an appropriate proxy for the two-year requirement in the statute. ACA notes that Montana and Utah do not require all years or hours of post-master\\u2019s degree clinical supervised experience to be completed after receiving a master\\u2019s degree. ACA believes CMS should allow additional flexibility for practitioners in these states consistent with their licensing laws so that such MHCs can enroll in Medicare to ensure uniform access to mental health diagnostic and treatment services for Medicare beneficiaries across state.\\n\\nAdditionally, ACA appreciates CMS\\u2019 proposal to amend the regulation at 42 C.F.R. \\u00a7 410.32(a) to include\\nMHCs on the list of practitioners who can order diagnostic tests, to the extent State law allows.\\n\\nACA appreciates CMS\\u2019 proposal to allow Addiction Counselors who meet all the proposed eligibility requirements for MHCs to also enroll in Medicare as MHCs.\\n\\nACA thanks CMS for proposing to revise the code descriptor for HCPCS code G0323 to allow MHCs and MFTs, as well as CPs and CSWs, to bill for General Behavioral Health Integration (BHI) services as part of a primary care team.  Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association (VHHA) supports CMS' provision to advance access to behavioral health services by covering services provided by MFTs and MHCs .  South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations SDAHO is pleased that CMS is allowing addiction counselors to enroll in Medicare as MHCs.  Texas Medical Association (TMA) supports the agency's proposal to include Medicare coverage and payment for the services of health care professionals who meet the qualifications of MFTs and MHCs. TMA believes it is imperative that CMS ensure that any future Medicare coverage policies do not expand the scope of practice for nonphysical health care professionals and urges CMS to continue to defer to state laws and rules that govern a health professional's scope of practice/licensure. The Legal Action Center (LAC) supports CMS\\u2019 proposal to create new regulations to define marriage and family therapists (MFTs) and mental health counselors (MHCs), and to specify the services these practitioners can provide. They also support CMS\\u2019 proposals to add MFT and MHC providers to the list of practitioners eligible to provide BHI services, order diagnostic tests, deliver Medicare telehealth services, and be subjected to limited-risk screening. \\n\\nLAC strongly supports CMS\\u2019 proposal to allow Addiction Counselors who meet all the applicable requirements of a MHC to enroll in Medicare as MHCs and bill Medicare for MHC services. However, LAC urges CMS to explicitly codify this inclusion at \\u00a7 410.54 to ensure that these providers and Medicare beneficiaries are aware of such coverage. \\n\\nLAC notes that not all states have licensure or certification standards for a type of addiction counselor that would meet the education and clinical requirements of a MHC. To ensure consistent access to SUD counseling throughout the country, and to increase access to treatment in the midst of the ongoing opioid public health emergency, LAC urges CMS to use its authority to develop additional codes for substance use counseling that could be delivered by these practitioners in office-based and community settings.\\n\\nLAC also urges CMS to work with Congress to authorize Medicare to cover addiction counselors who do not have master\\u2019s degrees but have the appropriate training and supervision to deliver reasonable and necessary SUD counseling services to Medicare beneficiaries. \\n\\nLAC is concerned that the proposed regulations prevent MFTs and MHCs (and clinical social workers) from delivering services to inpatients and that the proposed reimbursement rate is lower than that of non-physician medical practitioners. LAC recommends CMS consider add-on codes that would more appropriately value the work, time, and effort of these practitioners. The American Association of Psychiatric Pharmacists (AAPP) believes that expanding Medicare coverage to services provided by MFTs and MHCs a positive step that better recognizes the spectrum of providers of behavioral health care services. The Medicare Mental Health Workforce Coalition (MMHWC) is in support of the coverage of MFT and MHC services. However, they believe some MHCs and MFTs may not be eligible as they do not meet the supervised experience standard proposed in the rule. The MMHWC asks that CMS allow applicants to count supervised experience obtained prior to and after their licensure toward the 3,000-hour requirement set out in the rule or allow applicants to substitute equivalent hours of direct client content experience. MMHWC also asks CMS implement modifications to the provider enrollment of MFTs and MHCs for increased flexibility.\\n\\nMMHWC also supports CMS updating HCPCS code G0323 to allow MFTs and MHCs to bill for services, but asks CMS include MFTs and MHCs in all HCPCS codes currently utilized by Medicare behavioral health providers. \\n\\nMMHWC also believes that the new 42 CFR 414.53 to codify the payment formula for CSWs, MHCs, and MFTs, conforms to the requirements as stated in Section 4121 of the CAA, 2023.  The Coalition to Transform Advanced Care (C-TAC) supports the proposed regulatory language to include MFTs and MHCs in Medicare programs and looks forward to their contribution to improving access to much needed behavioral health services going forward. The American Academy of Pediatrics applauds CMS for its continued efforts to advance access to behavioral health services. Allowing marriage and family therapists and mental health counselors to furnish and bill for health behavior assessment and intervention services expands the available workforce to support patients and their families. The Medicare Rights Center applaud the regulatory changes that would implement the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 and urges CMS to consider ways to extend outreach and education to new and existing provider types, as well as potential increases to payment levels within statutory limits for provider types that are underrepresented in Medicare. The American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy believes that some MFTs and MHCs might not meet the supervised experience standard specified in the proposed rule and asks CMS to confirm the interpretation of the proposed rules 42 C.F.R. 410.53(a) and 410.54(b) in addition to the text relating to the existing mental health professions recognized by Medicare. The association urges CMS to allow applicants to count supervised experience obtained after receiving their license, along with the experience earned prior to receiving their license, as meeting the clinical supervised experience under 42 C.F.R. and 410.54(a)(2). Lastly, the Association asks CMS to consider allowing applicants who might not have performed at least 2 years or 3,000 hours of post master\\u2019s degree before becoming licensed but who provided an equivalent number of hours of direct client contact experience to meet the supervised experience requirement. \\n\\nEnrollment issues for MFTs and MHCS:\\nThe American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy asks CMS to consider accepting an attestation as evidence of having met the clinically supervised experience requirement. In addition, the Association asks CMS to modify provider enrollment regulations to provide flexibility for newly enrolling MFTs and MHCs on documenting this supervised experience. \\n\\nCoding update:\\nAmerican Association for Marriage and Family Therapy urges CMS to update code descriptors for all other HCPCS codes that are currently utilized by current Medicare behavioral health providers and encourage CMS to ensure that MFTs and MHCs are able to provide services and utilize applicable HCPCS codes. \\n\\nFee schedule:\\nThe American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy believes that the new 42 C.F.R. 414.53 conform to the requirements as stated in Section 4121 of the CAA, 2023. \\n The Patient Quality of Life Coalition (PQLC) support CMS\\u2019 implementation of the requirement that MFT and MHC services be eligible for reimbursement under Medicare Part B.\\n The Healthcare Association of New York State (HANYS) supports CMS' proposals to expand payment for services by MFTs, MHCs, addiction counselors, peer support workers, and CHWs. The National Association of ACOs (NAACOS) supports CMS expanding the types of providers that can deliver behavioral health services. The American Academy of Home Care Medicine (Academy) or (AAHCM)  supports the proposed changes by CMS to allow addiction counselors to enroll in Medicare as mental health counselors. They also back the inclusion of marriage and family therapists (MFTs) and mental health counselors in Medicare. The Academy emphasizes the importance of aligning definitions for professionals billing Medicare under the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) for consistency. They stress that these changes are crucial in addressing the increasing rates of mental illness and distress in the country. Additionally, they urge CMS to ensure that these services are covered in the home setting to ensure sustainability and accessibility of care. The Gerontological Society of America (GSA) agrees with CMS that this rule contains some of the most important changes to improve access to behavioral health in Medicare in the program\\u2019s history by allowing clinical social workers, marriage and family therapists, and mental health counselors, including addiction counselors, to enroll in Medicare and bill for their services. America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) supports the proposal to establish payment for services provided by MFTs and MHCs as their members have long supported expanding the types of behavioral health non- physician practitioners recognized by Medicare. CMS should, to the extent feasible, encourage consistency with and among states in the services that MFTs and MHCs are licensed to provide and for which they are eligible to be reimbursed. The Association for Behavioral Health and Wellness (ABHW) is grateful for the speedy implementation of the CAA23 and to CMS for adding MFTs and MHCs as providers in the Medicare program and urge CMS to consider expanding when clinical supervised experience requirements may be fulfilled.\\n\\nAdditionally, ABHW support the proposal to allow addiction counselors who have met requirements like MFTs and MHCs to become Medicare providers. Johnson & Johnson (J&J) supports including MFTs and MHCs in Medicare Part B and is encouraged by the positive impact it will have on Medicare beneficiary access to mental health services. NRHA applauds CMS's proposal to allow addiction counselors to enroll in Medicare as MHCs and supports MFTs and MHCs expanded ability to bill for and furnish Health Behavior Assessment and Intervention (HBAI) services. Kaiser Permanente supports CMS' proposal to provide coverage for MFTs and MHCs, but requests CMS clarify if MFTs and MHCs acting within their states' scope of practice can bill under Medicare.  The American Medical Association (AMA) would like for the definitions of MFT and MHCs to have a specific additional reference that they must adhere to state scope of practice requirements. Additionally, the MFT and/or MHC should be licensed in both the state in which the patient is receiving care and the state in which the practitioner is located.  The American Medical Group Association (AGMA) supports CMS'  plans to extend Part B coverage and reimbursement for the professional services rendered by marriage and family therapists (MFTs) and mental health counselors (MHCs).  The Association of American Medical Colleges (the AAMC) supports CMS\\u2019s effort to increase access to behavioral health care services by increasing payment for general behavioral health services and psychotherapy codes and allowing Marriage and Family Therapists (MFTs) and Mental Health Counselors (MHC) to independently bill Medicare services. AAMC encourages CMS to promote the use of interprofessional consults for behavioral  health by eliminating barriers, and to make changes to increase access to behavioral integration services. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) supports proposals expanding the coverage provisions that will ensure that patients get the mental health care they need at all stages of life and asks CMS to finalize the inclusion of MFTs and MHCs to the list of practitioners who can be paid for services by Medicare.  The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation supports increasing the type of providers and the valuation of services covered by Medicare in order for patients to access mental health services. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation feels this is in alignment with their published guidelines on screening and treatment for depression and anxiety among individuals with cystic fibrosis and caregivers for children with cystic fibrosis.  The Rural Policy Research Institute endorses adding MFTs and MHCs to the lists of practitioners eligible to order diagnostic tests and to furnish Medicare services.  The Association for Addiction Professionals (NAADAC) supports CMS\\u2019 proposal to permit those meeting the criteria applicable to Mental Health Counselors (MHCs) to enroll as Medicare providers. NAADAC requests that CMS explicitly codify Medicare coverage of Addiction Counselors within regulation. \\n\\nNAADAC also requests that CMS ensure that an Addiction Counselor possessing a master\\u2019s counseling degree, holding the Master Addictions Counselor (MAC) credential, and meeting any other requirements necessary to practice in their state meet the licensure and certification requirement for Medicare participation. NAADAC also urges CMS to work with Congress to authorize otherwise qualified Addiction Counselors who do not possess master\\u2019s degrees to participate in the Medicare program. The Center for Medicare Advocacy (the Center) supports CMS\\u2019 proposal to create new regulations to define marriage and family therapists (MFTs) and mental health counselors (MHCs), and to specify the services these practitioners can provide. The Center also supports CMS\\u2019 proposals to add these providers to the list of practitioners eligible to provide BHI services, order diagnostic tests, deliver Medicare telehealth services, and be subjected to limited-risk screening and are in support of CMS\\u2019 proposal to allow Addiction Counselors who meet all the applicable requirements of a MHC to enroll in Medicare as MHCs and bill Medicare for MHC services. They urge CMS to include \\u201caddiction counselor or alcohol and drug counselor\\u201d at \\u00a7\\u00a7 410.54(a)(1) and (3); \\u201caddiction counseling\\u201d at \\u00a7 410.54(a)(2); and \\u201csubstance use disorders\\u201d at \\u00a7 410.54(b)(1).\\n CVS Health supports CMS\\u2019 proposed expansion of the Part B coverage to include appropriately trained and licensed MFTs and MHCs. However, licensure and training requirements of these professionals may differ by state. They believe CMS should clarify the necessary qualifications and training MFTs and MHCs should possess for purposes of Medicare Part B coverage when these requirements vary at the state level. They recommend CMS specify who bears the responsibility to determine whether an MFT or MHC satisfies the Part B requirements. \\n The CAA adds a new benefit category under Medicare Part B to include MFT\\nand MHC services. CMS proposes to create new regulation sections to codify the coverage provisions, including the professionals and eligible services included in the coverage. CMS is proposing to implement the benefit according to provisions already outlined by the CAA; The American Hospital Association (AHA) supports this approach and appreciates that CMS is working to expand access to behavioral health services by allowing for qualified professionals to provide this vital care. In particular, AHA appreciates that CMS proposes to allow addiction counselors who meet the same coverage criteria to enroll in Medicare as MHCs. These specialized professionals offer unique services for people with addictions, and this provision will improve access to care. The Alliance for Patient Access (AfPA) states that the changes will improve access to behavioral health services for beneficiaries and supports including this provision in the final rule. Mental Health America (MHA) urges CMS to finalize its proposals to add MFTs, MHCs, and ACs to the Medicare program and to allow them to bill through telehealth, provide integrated care coordination, and order diagnostic tests within the scope of their practice under state law. MHA\\u2019s affiliates are very supportive of this increased workforce to address shortages and needs in their communities. The SCAN Foundation is excited to see proposals for  implementing CAA 2023 amendments to improve access to behavioral health services, including coverage of services provided by marriage and family therapists (MFTs) and inclusion of addiction counselors as mental health counselors (MHCs). Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) commends CMS for proposing to exceed Congress\\u2019 mandate in the statute and allowing addiction counselors to enroll in Medicare as MHCs. The American College of Physicians (ACP) is supportive of CMS' proposals to allow MFTs and MHCs to enroll in Medicare and bill for their services for the first time. ACP strongly believes this proposal will advance access to behavioral health services and expand the types of practitioners that can furnish these services as part of primary care.  National Coalition for Hospice and Palliative Care understands this is CMS\\u2019s effort to implement the legislative requirement that MFT and MHC services be eligible for reimbursement under Medicare. Patients with serious illness can often benefit from mental health and family therapy and in fact, access to these services is a cornerstone of palliative care. The Coalition is seeking additional guidance and clarification as the core members of the hospice interdisciplinary team currently includes the nurse (and other advanced practice providers), physician, social worker and chaplain. It appears that, section 1861(dd)(2)(B)(i)(III) of the Act was amended by 4121(b)(2) of the CAA, 2023 to require a hospice program to have an interdisciplinary team that includes at least one social worker, MFT or MHC. There are numerous published studies about the essential value of the social worker on the hospice IDG. 6 The Coalition strongly supports the continued role of the social worker on the hospice IDG. If these additional providers can also serve in an optional capacity (i.e., MFTs and MHCs are available to supplement the core IDG/IDT that continues to include social workers), the Coalition welcomes these changes. However, we are concerned that the new policy could lead to a decrease in hospice patients\\u2019 access to social workers. We therefore encourage CMS to monitor for unintended consequences of this change, including related to hospice beneficiaries\\u2019 social needs and access to community health services. The Community Oncology Alliance strongly supports proposals that increase the exposure of cancer patients to resources that can help them navigate their chronic conditions, including mental health services from providers like MFTs or MHCs.  Medical Group Management Association (MGMA) supports CMS\\u2019 efforts to expand patient access to behavioral health services and urges the agency to finalize the proposal defining and allowing payment for MFTs and MHCs. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) supports the additional focus on behavioral health in this rule and CMS' proposal to allow the Health Behavior Assessment and Intervention services described to be billed by clinical social workers, MFTs, and MHCs.  The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) applauds CMS\\u2019 implementation of this important change, and supports CMS\\u2019 proposal to allow Addiction Counselors who meet all the applicable requirements of a MHC to enroll in Medicare as MHCs and bill Medicare for MHC services. Michigan State Medical Society (MSMS) supports the recognition of individual state\\u2019s licensing laws in the definitions for Marriage and Family Therapists and Mental Health Counselors.  American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) strongly supports CMS\\u2019 proposal to allow Addiction Counselors who meet  all the applicable requirements of a MHC to enroll in Medicare as MHCs and bill Medicare for MHC services. However, ASAM urges CMS to explicitly codify this inclusion at \\u00a7410.54 to ensure that these providers and Medicare beneficiaries are aware of such coverage.  The American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living (AHCA/NCAL) support the policies to permit MFTs and MHCs to bill Medicare for behavioral health services beginning January 1, 2024, as proposed. The AHCA/NCAL appreciate the clarification in the proposed rule that the expanded behavioral health coverage to MFT and MHC practitioners is excluded from SNF Medicare Part A consolidated billing requirements and can be separately billed to Medicare Part B by the newly defined behavioral health practitioners beginning January 1, 2024. \\n American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) is pleased to see CMS implementing the expansion of providers who can receive reimbursement from Medicare to include MFTs and MHCs. AARP also supports CMS' proposal to allow addiction counselors to be considered MHCs. Increased access to MFTs and BHCs to provide care to patients will increase use of mental health services, improving outcomes and overall wellness. The National Association for Behavioral Healthcare (NABH) applauds this change and appreciate that newly enrolled MFTs and MHCs would be able to bill Medicare for services starting January 1, 2024. To clarify these new roles and facilitate efficient adoption, NABH recommend that new guidelines (both regulatory and sub-regulatory) use the phrase \\u201cmental health\\u201d or \\u201caddiction\\u201d services, rather than the more global \\u201cbehavioral health\\\".\\n\\nAdditionally, NABH urge CMS also to consider adding psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners to the list of clinicians who can certify and assist in treatment planning for IOP services to materially extend the clinical capacity of outpatient services, as this category of nurse practitioners are highly clinically trained and already serving a wide array of other clinical functions for our patient populations. The Medicare Mental Health Workforce Coalition supports the addition of MHCs and MFTs and provides several recommendations about supervised experience standards, strategies to increase enrollment, and coding approaches.  The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) is very supportive of CMS' efforts to provide Medicare Part B coverage and payment for the services of marriage and family therapists (MFTs) and mental health counselors (MHCs). ACEP also supports the proposal to  allow addiction counselors that meet all the applicable requirements to be an MHC to enroll in Medicare as MHCs  The American Psychological Association (APA) recommends CMS use the term Mental Health Professional (MHP) instead of Mental Health Counselor to be more inclusive of the types of professionals who may meet the applicable requirements for enrollment as a master\\u2019s level mental health provider. Additionally, the APA suggests that CMS should recognize Licensed Psychological Practitioner (Kentucky), Licensed Clinical Psychotherapist (Kansas), Licensed Psychological Associate (Texas), Psychologist-Masters (Vermont), and Psychologist (West Virginia) as MHCs or preferably as MHPs. Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) supports CMS\\u2019 approach to expanding the allowed MFTs and MHCs to bill Medicare but recommends continuing to evaluate the proposed definitions of MFTs and MHCs and how best to resolve conflicts with existing state definitions.  Cigna supports CMS\\u2019 proposals to implement these provisions from the CAA and expand access to additional behavioral health provider types under Medicare as they try and address critical shortages of behavioral health providers and needs for care.\",\n          \"Premier Inc. supports CMS\\u2019 proposed delay in moving to the previously finalized definition. Premier Inc. recommends that CMS publicly commit to not moving forward with a revised definition until the AMA CPT Editorial Panel has finished revising certain aspects of shared or split visits. Premier Inc. continues to have concerns that CMS\\u2019 proposal to define \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d based on time will create a significant administrative burden on care teams and may ultimately discourage team-based care. Premier Inc. also recommends that CMS  provide an alternative method for determining substantive portion of the split visit based on either history of present illness, physical exam or MDM that is consistent with prior guidance.  ACOFP supports the delay in implementation of the \\\"substantive portion\\\" to allow providers to adjust their practices for the policy change. American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) agrees with CMS' proposal to retain the current policy through CY 2024 and asks CMS to consider a policy for CY 2025 and beyond that, when MDM is used to select the E/M level for a shared/split visit and physician documentation supports physician contribution to MDM, then the physician should automatically be considered to be the provider who furnished the substantial portion and the one to bill for the visit.  The Alliance of Dedicated Cancer Centers (ADCC) appreciates CMS\\u2019 proposal to continue the 2022/2023 policy for split/shared visits through 2024. For 2024 and beyond, the ADCC asks CMS to define practitioner contribution to medical decision making (MDM) as the substantive portion for shared/split visit billing. If CMS relies on time alone for definition of the substantive portion, the ADCC asks that when time is the basis of selecting the E/M level, CMS define the substantive portion of the visit for a physician at 25% rather than 50% of the total visit time. The American Nurses Association (ANA) supports CMS\\u2019 proposal to delay the implementation of the split E/M proposal through the end of calendar year 2024. The ANA would also support a delay beyond the additional one year proposed, not only to analyze claims experience sufficiently, but also for policymakers to engage stakeholders to fully understand variations in practices and staffing approaches for these codes.  The American Academy of Family Physicians supports CMS\\u2019s proposal to effectively maintain its current definition of \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d of a split (or shared) visit through December 31, 2024. The American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) are pleased with the continued delay in implementation and urge CMS to rescind the proposal permanently. Michigan Medicine (MM) appreciates the decision to delay the requirement that only the physician or qualified health professional who spends more than half the total time with a patient during a split/shared visit can bill for the visit. MM recommends that this policy be delayed indefinitely.  The American Society of Pediatric Nephrology (ASPN) supports the agency\\u2019s decision to maintain the current definition of \\u201csubstantive portion.\\u201d However, ASPN believes that using time as the sole or most important factor when determining which provider should bill for a split/shared service is not appropriate, and that the ongoing inclusion of medical-decision-making as an additional criteria allows for more precise assignment of a billing provider dependent on substantive care delivered. ASPN appreciates CMS maintaining flexibility in defining the practitioner who provided the substantive portion of the visit and urges the agency to maintain the current standard permanently. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) appreciates CMS proposing to delay implementation of the previously finalized policy used to determine the substantive portion of a split (or shared visit) until 2025.\\n\\nThe AAN is extremely concerned with the changes finalized in the 2022 MPFS redefining the \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d of a split (or shared) visit. These changes would amend the definition of \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d for the purposes of determining who may bill for a split (or shared) visit to mean \\u201cmore than half of the total time spent by the physician and NPP performing the split (or shared) visit.\\u201d The AAN believes this new definition is not aligned with changes already implemented for\\noutpatient and more recently inpatient E/M services.\\n\\nThe AAN urges CMS to consider the AAN\\u2019s recommendations and to prioritize the minimization of documentation burden. The AAN strongly urges CMS not to disrupt team-based care in facility settings and to revise the split (or shared) visit policy to allow the physician or NPP who is doing the cognitive work that drives the patient\\u2019s care to bill for the service. \\n\\nThe AAN is grateful to CMS for continuing to delay implementation of the previously finalized policy, as we believe it will be a significant impediment for neurology practices and thereby lead to delays or limitations to access to care for their patients. However, the AAN is concerned about the confusion and disruption caused by the lack of clarity regarding permanent policy continuing to loom over providers. The AAN encourages CMS to work with the physician community to expeditiously develop a permanent policy that allows for the substantive portion of a split (or shared) visit to be determined on the basis of either time or MDM. Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association (VHHA) ask that CMS permanently delay the implementation of the proposed policy that would only reimburse physicians for a split/shared visit if they perform a \\\"substantive\\\" portion of the visit.  The New Jersey Hospital Association (NJHA) is pleased that CMS is proposing to further delay implementation of its split/shared visit policy. Previously proposed arrangement would have resulted in significant reductions and redistributions in physician revenue, on top of those in the CY 2024 PFS proposed and other cuts. South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations (SDAHO) thanks CMS for delaying implementation of this policy and recommends that CMS withdraw the \\\"substantive portion\\\" policy and continue using its current history, exam, or medical decision-making policy.  The American Urological Association (AUA) firmly believes that billing for split/shared services should align with the billing criteria applied to other E/M services \\u2013 based on MDM or time. This approach ensures consistency and equitable treatment across various types of services, reflecting the AUA\\u2019s commitment to streamlining practices, promoting fair billing standards and ultimately providing higher quality patient care. The retention of MDM-based billing for split/shared services would not only enhance clarity but also facilitate a more straightforward and transparent billing process. Texas Medical Association (TMA) appreciate and concur with CMS' proposal to further delay implementation of changes to split/shared billing arrangement. TMA asks CMS to clarify how the agency will process claims using one of the three key components (history, exam, or medical decision-making).  The Healthcare Business Management Association (HBMA) agrees with CMS\\u2019 proposal to delay implementation of its methodology for determining which provider furnished the substantive portion of a split (or shared) service. They urge CMS to make important changes to its finalized policy to reduce burdens and align with current documentation and clinical practices. This becomes even more important as 2024 CPT changes specific to time and split/shared visits are unknown at this time. More closely aligning CMS and AMA CPT coding guidelines is an important and needed goal.\\n\\nHBMA recommends CMS continue allowing both medical decision-making and time as options for billing split (or shared) services, consistent with all other E/M services. They also strongly recommend that CMS stop carving out specific visit types to impose rules that do not match other E/M changes and requirements. HBMA also wants to stress again to CMS that the long history of issuing rules and implementation dates and then delaying said rules year after year is in and of itself a significant burden. Physicians and their representatives spend unfunded, valuable resources in time, education, training, practice analysis, and system programming in preparation. The CMS statement that the current additional proposed delay is through, \\u201cat least December 31, 2024\\u201d and \\u201cwhether a further\\nimplementation delay beyond CY 2024\\u2026is warranted\\u201d demonstrates CMS\\u2019 failure to recognize the additional burdens this places on practices that have no way to know if or when the rule will ever be implemented.\\n The American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) supports the agency\\u2019s proposal to maintain the current definition of \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d when determining which practitioner should bill for a split/shared service. The ACNS has been consistently opposed to using time as the determinative factor when determining which provider bills for a split/shared service and appreciates that CMS has listened to stakeholders and reconsidered\\nthis policy. The ACNS appreciates that the agency continues to seek feedback stakeholders on this issue if future changes are considered. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) thank CMS for proposing this continued delay and urge CMS to finalize in the 2024 PFS final rule allowing physicians or qualified health providers (QHPs) to bill split or shared visits based on time or medical decision making. Pediatrix supports CMS' proposal to delay the transition to using only time to determine the substantive portion of a split or shared service. Pediatrix urges CMS to continue its current policy even beyond 2024, as it more appropriately reflects the collaboration of both the physician and non-physician practitioner. Pediatrix is concerned that a transition to using time only to determine a substantive portion of a split/shared visit will have significant impacts on providers and increase administrative burdens.  With regards to the policy for \\\"split\\\" or \\\"shared\\\" services, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) supports the delay of the full implementation of the definition of substantive portion as more than half of the total time until Jan. 1, 2024. They also reiterate their comments to the CY2022 MPFS proposed rule related to MDM. MD Anderson Cancer Center is concerned with any proposals that define substantive portion of a split/shared visit by only time and propose that substantive portion of a visit be defined by either time or medical decision making.  The North American Neuromodulation Society (NANS) supports the proposed delay in implementation of the split/shared billing changes and believes it benefits patients first and foremost, as well as physicians and practices alike. However, they continue to believe that defining the \\\"substantive portion\\\" to mean more than half of the total visit time is shortsighted and does not recognize that other aspects besides visit time contributes to physician work. The American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) is appreciative of CMS' proposal to extend the use of the current definition of \\\"substantive portion\\\" but continues to strongly urge CMS to permanently revise the definition for \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d to be based on MDM and not time, which coincides with AMA CPT guidelines. The AAOS continues to strongly encourage CMS to work with CPT for cohesive guidance on the reporting of split/shared visits in CPT Guidelines and CMS policy. The Digestive Health Physicians Association (DHPA) appreciates CMS's proposal to delay implementation of the definition of \\\"substantive portion\\\" as more than half of the total time until January 1, 2025. The DPHA believes the more appropriate action would be for CMS to make permanent its approach to the definition of \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d that has been in effect since CY 20227, or, at the very least, redefine \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d to include either more than 50% of the medical decision-making by the physician or NPP or more than 50% of the time spent by the physician or NPP. DPHA urges CMS to announce in the Final Rule for CY 2024 that it will maintain a more flexible approach to defining \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d not only for CY 2024, but on a permanent basis.  The American Society of Nephrology (ASN) believes CMS's policy on split (shared) E&M visits is misguided and deemphasizes the importance of medical decision making and thus the role of the physician.\\n\\nCMS proposes to maintain the current definition of substantive portion for CY 2024 that\\nallows for use of either one of the three key components (history, exam, or MDM) or\\nmore than half of the total time spent to determine who bills the visit. ASN applauds the partial delay decision, but we urge CMS to withdraw the policy altogether in the final rule. The American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) thanks CMS for proposing this delay and urge CMS to finalize in the 2024 PFS final rule allowing physicians or QHPs to bill split or shared visits based on time or medical decision making. They support the inclusion of all four elements when determining who should bill for the visit to best capture accurate contributions: (1) History, (2) performing a physical examination, (3) making a medical decision, and (4) spending time. ASE urges CMS to allow the split or shared visit policy to continue to allow the physician or QHP who is managing and overseeing the patient\\u2019s care and course of treatment to bill for the service. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) welcomes this delay in implementing a time-based standard for billing of split visits.  MSKCC believes defining the substantive portion as 50 percent or more of the total visit time fails to recognize that the value of the physician contribution to such visits is not derived from time-intensive and essential, but non-complex, tasks such as tracking down test results; explaining terms to patients and family members; or performing preliminary documentation. MSKCC believes paying for split E/M visits at the lower APP rate of 85 percent of the PFS completely fails to account for the physician contribution to the visit when determining the appropriate reimbursement rate.\\n\\nMSKCC has concerns about the administrative burden associated with ensuring that clinician time is tracked and recorded accurately, particularly in scenarios where an APP and a physician are simultaneously present for a portion of the split visit.\\n\\nMSKCC recommends CMS should continue to allow providers to determine who performed the substantive portion of the visit based either on time or MDM. \\n\\nPer the technical Correction for Split (or Shared) Critical Care Services, MSKCC urges CMS to reconsider the necessity of diverging from CPT guidance. MSKCC calls on CMS to respond to these concerns in future rulemaking by fully aligning the Medicare coding policy for critical care E/M billing with the CPT coding guidance.\\n\\n Vizient applauds CMS for delaying the split (or shared) policy. Vizient heard and continues to hear concerns from provider members regarding the operational challenges associated with this transition and unintended consequences related to compensation agreements. Further, Vizient emphasizes the importance of medical decision making (MDM) and believes a more flexible approach to split (or shared) visits is critical to ongoing support of team-based care. \\n\\nVizient recommends CMS rescind the CY 2022 PFS final rule policy regarding the substantive portion of split (or shared) visits and opt for a more flexible approach that is significantly less burdensome and more effectively considers the different types of contributions from the care team. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) supports CMS' decision to maintain the current definition for the \\\"substantive portion\\\" of the service and asks CMS to continue working with stakeholders on the definition The American Society of Hematology (ASH) supports the agency\\u2019s proposal to maintain the current definition of \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d when\\ndetermining which practitioner should bill for a split/shared service and appreciates that CMS continues to delay using time as the determinative factor as to which provider will bill the service.  The Society of General Internal Medicine (SGIM) supports the agency\\u2019s proposal to maintain the current definition of \\u201csubstantive portion.\\\" SGIM recommends that the agency continue to allow for billing by MDM or time for these services as this represents usual practice patterns and will reduce the burden on providers and be more consistent with the rest of the E/M code families. When using MDM as a determinate for billing, SGIM recommends that CMS implement clear requirements for demonstrating that the billing provider, either the physician or non-physician practitioner, implemented their own critical thinking and planning. American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation supports the proposal to allow \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d to be based on either history, exam, medical decision making, or time through CY 2024. In addition, American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation further requests that CMS fully withdraw previously finalized policy that requires determining the practitioner to provided the \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d of a split (or shared) E/M service by time and adopt the recently updated CPT guideline for determining when a physician can report a split or shared E/M visit effective January 1, 2025.  The California Hospital Association (CHA) strongly supports delaying the split billing policy. CHA respectfully asks CMS to reconsider its decision to base the definition of the \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d on more than half of the total time once this policy goes into effect. CHA encourages CMS to allow for the determination of the \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d of a split visit based on who provided the preponderance of the medical decision-making, according to the provider\\u2019s attestation. Not only will this address concerns about the unnecessary physician resources spent tracking time during the split visit, but it will more appropriately reimburse the service based on the degree of cognitive services provide. The Patient Quality of Life Coalition (PQLC) support further delay of this policy. As CMS continues to evaluate its E/M policy, the PQLC encourage the agency to align with E/M level selection policies \\u2013 that is, to allow clinicians to choose between time and medical decision making \\u2013 to determine which practitioner performs the substantive portion of the visit.\\n The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) supports the delay of this policy and urges CMS to reconsider its future implementation. ASA recommends CMS permanently finalize this alternative policy that allows physicians or qualified health care professionals to bill split or shared visits based on time or medical decision-making. The American Medical Rehabilitation Providers Association (AMRPA) urges CMS to permanently withdraw its delayed policy for billing split or shared E/M services and advance a policy to adequately account for the unique role of physicians by allowing billing based on history, exam, medical decision-making, OR time.  The Society of Hospital Medicine (SHM) is supportive of continuing the transition period\\u2014in which time, MDM, or History & Physical could be used to determine which provider performed the \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d of the visit\\u2014and urges CMS to work with relevant stakeholders to develop a policy that better reflects the reality of team-based care. SHM urges CMS to adopt the approach recommended by the AMA CPT Editorial Panel. If the CPT guidance is not within CMS\\u2019 preferred methodologies, SHM suggests CMS could otherwise develop a policy maintaining the use of MDM for determining which provider can bill for the split (or shared) visit.\\n The Endocrine Society is pleased that CMS will again delay implementing the previously proposed policy regarding shared/split visits. The Endocrine Society supports defining \\\"substantive portion\\\" as the practitioner who provides the medical decision making OR spends the most time providing care to the patient. The Endocrine Society suggests that in future rule making the agency finalize this definition of substantive portion.  The Emergency Department Practice Management Association (EDPMA)  appreciates that CMS delayed the planned CY 2024 shared (or split) services policy and urges the Agency to maintain its current policy permanently. EDPMA applauds CMS\\u2019 decision to maintain the current definition of \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d under the split (or shared) visits policy, which allows the billing practitioner to be selected based on the practitioner that performs the medical decision making (MDM) for the selected services. EDPMA opposes any future implementation of a definition of \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d that is based solely on time, particularly as it applied to ED E/M visits.  EDPMA believes that CMS\\u2019 current policy should be maintained and provides the flexibility necessary for identifying the \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d for ED E/M visits, but if CMS proceeds with a \\u201ctime only\\u201d approach in 2025 or later, EDPMA urges CMS to put forward a proposal to address the unique ED setting and acknowledge \\u201ctime only\\u201d is not applicable in the ED setting. EDPMA recommends that, for purposes of determining the \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d in the context of the ED E/M code set, CMS maintain its current policy and refrain from implementing a \\u201ctime only\\u201d policy in CY 2025 or at any point in the future. The American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) supports CMS' decision to maintain its current policy for split/shared E/M services and urges GMS to permanently finalize its current policy that allows for selection of the billing practitioner based on performance of a key element of the E/M or more than half of total time.  The Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania (HAP) appreciates the delay in implementing the split visit proposal and strongly urges CMS to fully reconsider implementing the proposal in which \\\"substantive portion\\\" is based on time. HAP believes that as has been the practice, medical decision-making should determine the appropriate level of E/M visit.  The American Association of Clinical Urologists (AACU) supports the suspension of proposed changes to the split/shared services for 2024 and believes it is prudent to await further input from the CPT Editorial Panel.  The American Osteopathic Association (AOA) supported CMS's proposed policy for split (or shared) E/M visits for physicians and other qualified health care professionals in the facility setting where \\\"incident to\\\" billing is not allowed. However, AOA expressed significant concern about CMS's proposal to define the \\\"substantive portion\\\" of a split or shared E/M visit based on the practitioner who provides \\\"more than half of the total time\\\" during the visit. They argued that this proposal contradicts CPT guidelines, which allow E/M services to be reported based on either time or medical decision-making and defines how the substantive portion of a visit can be determined for each. AOA supported CMS's delay in implementing this revised definition and urged CMS to align any changes with CPT coding guidelines. They also advocated for the continued use of either one of the three key components of a visit (history, exam, or medical decision-making) or more than half of the total time spent to determine billing for a service. The Federation of American Hospitals (FAH) strongly supports this proposal to  delay the implementation of its definition\\nof the \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d of a shared visit as more than half of the total time through at least December 31, 2024 and urges CMS to make it permanent. National Rural Health Association (NRHA) urges CMS to withdraw its substantive portion policy and should not move forward with this policy in CY 2025 as it disenfranchises rural beneficiaries and providers.  American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) commends CMS for continuing to allow physicians and QHPs to bill split or shared visits based on time or medical decision-making, which will prevent disruptions to team-based care delivered in the facility setting. AUGS urges CMS to consider the CPT Editorial Panel\\u2019s recent work on this issue as part of the revisions to the E/M guidelines that will be published in the CPT 2024 Professional Code Book before changing the current policy on split or shared E/M services.  The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) supports CMS' decision to delay the implementation of changes to how split/shared E/M visits are coded. The AAO-HNS urges CMS to propose an alternative policy that allows physicians and other providers to bill split or shared visits based on time or medical decision-making.\\n The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) appreciates the delay of the substantive portion policy until January 1, 2025, as the policy (to report only on time) would disrupt team-based care. SVS urges CMS to allow physicians to bill split or shared visits based on time or medical decision-making.\\n Kaiser Permanente supports CMS' proposal to delay implementation of the substantive portion definition and suggests CMS continue to delay until the AMA changes are available.  The American Medical Association (AMA) strongly urges CMS to adopt the CPT guidelines for determining when a physician may report E/M service and to implement this policy following the one-year delay, effective January 1, 2025, to give physicians and practitioners sufficient time to incorporate this guidance into their clinical practice. \\n\\nImportantly, adoption of the guidance would allow physicians or QHPs to report split or shared visits based on time or medical decision-making. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) appreciate and support CMS\\u2019 proposal to delay implementation of the revised guidelines for billing attribution for split/shared E/M services. ATS and CHEST also urge CMS to use the additional time to solicit input from the physician community to further revise the split/shared policy to fully recognize the value medical decision-making plays in E/M services and move away from a \\u201ccounting minutes\\u201d approach for split/shared E/M billing attribution. The American Medical Group Association (AGMA) agrees with CMS\\u2019 decision to delay the split visit E/M policy and urges CMS to forgo the policy altogether. The American Association of Sleep Medicine (AASM) strongly urges CMS to move forward by adopting the CPT guidelines for determining when a physician may report the E/M service, with the same implementation date of January 1, 2025, as adoption of this guidance would allow physicians or qualified health professionals (QHPs) to report split or shared visits based on time or medical decision making. The Association of American Medical Colleges (the AAMC) supports a delay in implementing the time-based definition of substantive portion for split (or shared) visits. AAMC urges CMS to finalize an alternative policy that would allow billing of split (or shared) visits based on who performs more than 50% of the time or who performs the key medical decision-making component of the service. Time is not the most critical component of a complex medical decision. The Renal Physicians Association (RPA) once again strongly urges CMS to permanently withdraw its proposed definition of substantive portion of a split/shared visit and explore an alternate path that sufficiently accounts for the primacy of medical decision making in such a definition. The American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM) supports in delaying the effective date of the \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d policy and urges CMS to finalize a permanent policy that would allow the determination of the substantive portion of the visit to be based on either medical decision making or furnishing more than half the total time spent on the visit. The Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) is deeply concerned that basing the definition of shared E/M visits solely on which practitioner spends the most time with the patient will disadvantage physicians and disincentivize a team-based approach to patient care. HRS urge CMS to permanently modify the policy to allow E/M visits to be selected based on time or MDM. The American Hospital Association (AHA) continues to have substantial concerns about about using time to define the \\\"substantive portion\\\" of a split E/M visit and thus supports CMS\\u2019 proposal to delay its implementation. The AHA urges CMS to use this delay to re-examine this policy, including by working with stakeholders to develop an alternative proposal to billing split or shared visits. The American College of Physicians (ACP) urges CMS to refine its policy regarding split/shared visits. Though ACP is pleased that CMS is proposing to delay implementation of its policy finalized in CY22, ACP has recommended that CMS transition to using either MDM or time to determine the substantive portion of the visit. ACP recommends that when the physician participates and meaningfully contributes to the MDM or when the physician meets the time threshold, then the physician should be considered to have performed the substantive portion of the visit.  The UnitedHealth Group (UHG) believes that there needs to be a way of identifying when physician assistants (PAs) provide E/M services that are shared or split visits.  By identifying PAs, for the purposes of calculating quality scores, they are not immediately put into a lower threshold, get full credit for services provided to\\nthe patient, and are eligible for the full incentives.\\n The Community Oncology Alliance believes that delayed implementation of changes to the definition of \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d will provide community oncology practices with additional staff to train staff on handling changes with respect to the shared visit policy. The Alliance also recognizes that non-physician practitioners trained on standard coding and documenting practices can ease physician burden and prevent burnout.  Medical Group Management Association (MGMA) encourages CMS to finalize the proposal to continue defining \\u201csubstantial portion\\u201d for purposes of split or shared E/M services to better reflect the team-based approach to care utilized by medical practices. MGMA appreciates the proposed delay through 2024 and urges CMS to adopt CPT guidelines for determining when a physician may report a split or shared E/M visit.  The Association for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends that CMS propose an alternative policy in the CY 2024 Medicare Physician Payment Schedule Final Rule that allows physicians or APPs to bill split or shared visits based on either time or medical\\ndecision-making, following the 2023 changes to E/M services, to mitigate the negative impact that the time-only option will likely have on patient care.\\n The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) strongly agrees with the proposed delay and again recommends that CMS permanently\\nreverse the policy change.\\n\\nAGS recommends that CMS extend its shared visit policy to certain home visit and continue to recommend that CMS will support team-based care by clarifying that O/O E/M services for new patients can be furnished on an incident-to basis. The Minnesota Hospital Association (MHA) appreciates CMS proposing to delay split/shared evaluation and management. Although MHA supports the delay, they are still concerned about the eventual operationalization of the split/shared E/M visit policy Michigan State Medical Society (MSMS) supports the proposal to delay the implementation of the definition of \\u201csubstantial portion\\u201d for\\npurposes of split/shared billing for another year.  The American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) strongly urges CMS to allow physicians and QHPs to select the billing practitioner for split or shared visits based on time or medical decision-making. The Large Urology Group Practice Association (LUGPA) urges CMS to finalize its proposal to continue the delay of the split/shared billing requirements to prevent payment cuts and refrain from disrupting current team-based practice patterns.  The American Psychiatric Association (APA) supports maintaining the current definition of \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d. The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP)  supports CMS\\u2019 proposal to delay the implementation of the full transition to time only, and we continue to support the current policy to use the history or physical exam or medical decision-making (MDM), or more than half of the total time spent with a patient to determine the substantive portion of the split/shared visit due to the inequivalence of time physicians spend treating patients to the time that non-physician practitioners spend with patients. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) supports CMS' proposal to delay the requirement that only the physician or qualified health professional who spends more than half of the total time with the patient during a split or shared visit can bull for the visit. However, the ACC urges CMS to fully abandon this policy in the CY 2024 final rule. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) supports the delay in implementing the time-based definition of substantive portion of split/shared visits and urges CMS to finalize an alternative policy allowing billing based on who performs more than 50% of the time or who performs the key medical decision-making component.  The American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) supports the proposal to delay the implementation of the definition of substantive portion as more than half of the total time performing the split (or shared) service until January 1, 2025. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) supports the decision by CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) to further delay the implementation of the split or shared visit policy, allowing physicians to bill based on the existing definition of the \\\"substantive portion,\\\" which includes history, exam, medical decision-making, or more than half of the total time through the end of 2024. STS also encourages CMS to align their policy with the revised CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) guidelines in the 2024 CPT book. This delay addresses concerns raised about the \\\"more than half the total time\\\" definition and allows for a more comprehensive review of the policy. The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO) supports CMS delaying the implementation of its definition of the \\u201csubstantive portion\\u201d in regard to split or shared evaluation and management (E/M) services through December 31, 2024. \\n\\nNHPCO recommends E/M level selection policies should allow providers to choose between time and medical decision making to determine which provider performed the substantive portion of the visit. The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine supports the proposed delay of the requirement that only the physician or practitioner who spends more than half the total time with the patient during a split or shared visit can bill for the visit. The Society strongly urges CMS to adopt the CPT guidelines for determining when a physician may report the E/M service and to implement this policy following the one-year delay to give practitioners sufficient time to incorporate this guidance into their clinical practice.  Envision Healthcare strongly supports CMS\\u2019 proposal to further delay the transition to time-only billing, and urges the agency to discard this proposed transition entirely.\\n The International Society for the Advancement of Spine Surgery (ISASS) continue to believe that this proposal is shortsighted and does not recognize that other aspects besides visit time contribute to physician work. ISASS supports the proposed delay in implementation of the split/shared billing changes and believe it benefits patients first and foremost, as well as physicians and practices alike.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Char_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": 8904,\n        \"max\": 78033,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          78033,\n          25293,\n          36231\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summarizer_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Groq_mixtral\",\n          \"gpt-4\",\n          \"gpt-4-turbo-preview\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The majority of medical professionals and organizations, including LifeNet Health (LNH) and the American College of Surgeons (ACS), are urging the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to reconsider its approach to skin substitute reimbursement.

The Coalition of Wound Care Manufacturers (The Coalition) suggests that CMS continue to make separate payments for cellular and/or tissue-based products (CTPs) until it can demonstrate that quality of care and access to beneficiaries will not be impacted. They also suggest that CMS publish all CTP average sales prices (ASPs) and use its enforcement authority to ensure accurate and timely reporting.\\n\\nThe Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the American Medical Association (AMA) also advocate for separate payment for skin substitutes, with the AMA suggesting that high-cost disposable supplies priced at more than $500 should be identified and paid for separately. BioTissue emphasizes that any changes to payment methodology for skin substitutes should exclude FDA-approved drugs and biologic products.\\n\\nThe Alliance of Wound Care Stakeholders (The Alliance) argues that the proposed change to pay for skin substitutes as incident to supplies is complex and will negatively impact patient access, suggesting CMS should pay per the ASP methodology. Integra LifeSciences expresses similar concerns, arguing that CMS should not propose changes to skin substitute coding and payment unless specific details are provided for public comment.\\n\\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Academy of Dermatology Association (AADA) support efforts to improve payments for skin substitutes, with the AADA advocating for separate payment for high-cost disposable supplies. Smith + Nephew (S+N) warns against packaging approaches that could reduce access and increase amputations, while the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) expresses concern over treating skin substitutes as \\\"incident to supplies\\\", urging CMS to continue providing separate payment for these products under the ASP methodology.\",\n          \"A number of medical professional organizations and societies have expressed their opinions on the implementation of HCPCS add-on code G2211, which allows for separate payment for complex patients. While some support the implementation of the code, many have raised concerns about the lack of clarity around its purpose, use, and reporting. There are also concerns about the duplication of documentation efforts, overpayments, and disruptions to Relative Value Units (RVUs) and the Physician Fee Schedule. Some have suggested that CMS should restore the Refinement Panel process and work with the AMA RUC to establish relative value units for the Medicare physician fee schedule. There are also concerns about the budget neutrality adjustment and its impact on the conversion factor in outyears. Overall, while there is support for the idea of paying for additional resources and complexity in caring for patients, there are many questions and concerns about the implementation of this specific code.\",\n          \"The American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Neurology (AAN), American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), and other medical organizations and professionals strongly support the continuation and permanent coverage of audio-only telehealth services.

The ACR believes the critical components of providing best practice treatments options with biologics and immunomodulatory therapies and protecting the patient and care team relationship are at the highest level of ethical responsibility to our patients and their access to quality healthcare in treating their rheumatologic conditions.\\nCMS plays a crucial role in working with the specialties affected by these policies to identify long- term solutions to the current issues of down coding for services billed for the administration of biologics and the drugs added to the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list. The ACR is concerned that the criteria used for these two policies contradict the proposed nondiscrimination rules created for Medicare Fee-for-Service.\\n\\u201cDowncoding\\u201d The downcoding of complex chemotherapy services has reached a deep concern as it relates to the billing of biologics for the treatment of most non-oncologic conditions. This is mainly due to flawed billing and coding articles created by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that have restricted which complex therapies will be reimbursed using the \\u201cchemotherapy\\u201d administration codes, forcing rheumatologists and other specialists (except for hematology and oncology) to bill these services with the therapeutic drug administration code. The advent and evolution of biologics and other immunomodulating therapies have revolutionized outcomes for patients with auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis, which carry significant morbidity, mortality, and associated healthcare and societal costs. Despite the up-front costs, adding biologics to other treatment modalities has been cost-effective in appropriate patient populations.1\\nThe American Medical Association (AMA) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) states, \\u201cChemotherapy administration codes 96401-96549 apply to parenteral administration of non- radionuclide antineoplastic drugs; and also to anti-neoplastic agents provided for treatment of noncancer diagnoses (e.g., cyclophosphamide for auto-immune conditions) or to substances such as certain monoclonal antibody agents, and other biologic response modifiers.\\u201d Yet, the MACs continue to utilize unsubstantiated criteria to determine which drugs should be defined as complex and warrant the use of complex administration codes.\\nIn 2013, the American College of Rheumatology released its position outlining the common clinical situations that require the use of intravenous biologics as opposed to self-administered biologics and outlined the FDA indications, appropriate use, safety, and off-label use for biologics, which are far more complicated at the molecular level than traditional chemically synthesized drugs.2 Also, based on the evolution of biologics and monoclonal antibody treatments on the market for auto-immune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, dermatology, neurology, and other key areas of medicine, it is appropriate to review the definition of \\u201cchemotherapy,\\u201d which is no longer a useful term, as indications and toxicity should distinguish drugs. The CPT manual also states that \\u201cThe highly complex infusion of chemotherapy or other drug or biologic agents requires a physician or other qualified health care professional work and/or clinical staff monitoring well beyond that of therapeutic drug agents (96360-96379) because the incidence of severe adverse patient reactions are typically greater. These services can be provided by any physician or other qualified health care professional.\\u201d Accordingly, the ACR\\u2019s position statement indicates that given the complexity associated with the design, manufacturing, and storage of biologics and differences over time in the structure, efficacy, and safety of biologics, these treatments should be supervised and carried out by specially trained physicians and advanced practitioners who have the required knowledge, training, and experience to administer biologic agents and monitor adverse reactions. The ACR recommends that CPT work with the key stakeholders to change the terminology in the manual from \\u201cchemotherapy\\u201d to \\u201cimmunomodulatory\\u201d therapies, which is more in line with drug indications.\\nAs a reminder, the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) Congress included language allowing the use of the chemotherapy administration code by physicians who administer non-oncologic medications in their offices. The policy also indicated that the same level of supervision was required, and there are no significant differences between earlier biologics and currently proposed biologics in their level of risk in administration. Another key point in the MMA also outlined that these treatments should cost the same to administer, including clinical labor costs, and that no specialty should be reimbursed more than the other. Unfortunately, this has also caused another issue in how \\u201cchemotherapy\\u201d is assigned with the J-codes versus monoclonal antibody and biologic therapies through HCPCS. There are more than one example of a particular drug used as cancer therapy and an immunomodulator to treat different types of arthritis and vasculitis.

The ACR believes the critical components of providing best practice treatments options with biologics and immunomodulatory therapies and protecting the patient and care team relationship are at the highest level of ethical responsibility to our patients and their access to quality healthcare in treating their rheumatologic conditions.', 'CMS plays a crucial role in working with the specialties affected by these policies to identify long- term solutions to the current issues of down coding for services billed for the administration of biologics and the drugs added to the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list. The ACR is concerned that the criteria used for these two policies contradict the proposed nondiscrimination rules created for Medicare Fee-for-Service.', '“Downcoding” The downcoding of complex chemotherapy services has reached a deep concern as it relates to the billing of biologics for the treatment of most non-oncologic conditions. This is mainly due to flawed billing and coding articles created by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that have restricted which complex therapies will be reimbursed using the “chemotherapy” administration codes, forcing rheumatologists and other specialists (except for hematology and oncology) to bill these services with the therapeutic drug administration code. The advent and evolution of biologics and other immunomodulating therapies have revolutionized outcomes for patients with auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis, which carry significant morbidity, mortality, and associated healthcare and societal costs. Despite the up-front costs, adding biologics to other treatment modalities has been cost-effective in appropriate patient populations.1', 'The American Medical Association (AMA) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) states, “Chemotherapy administration codes 96401-96549 apply to parenteral administration of non- radionuclide antineoplastic drugs; and also to anti-neoplastic agents provided for treatment of noncancer diagnoses (e.g., cyclophosphamide for auto-immune conditions) or to substances such as certain monoclonal antibody agents, and other biologic response modifiers.” Yet, the MACs continue to utilize unsubstantiated criteria to determine which drugs should be defined as complex and warrant the use of complex administration codes.', 'In 2013, the American College of Rheumatology released its position outlining the common clinical situations that require the use of intravenous biologics as opposed to self-administered biologics and outlined the FDA indications, appropriate use, safety, and off-label use for biologics, which are far more complicated at the molecular level than traditional chemically synthesized drugs.2 Also, based on the evolution of biologics and monoclonal antibody treatments on the market for auto-immune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, dermatology, neurology, and other key areas of medicine, it is appropriate to review the definition of “chemotherapy,” which is no longer a useful term, as indications and toxicity should distinguish drugs. The CPT manual also states that “The highly complex infusion of chemotherapy or other drug or biologic agents requires a physician or other qualified health care professional work and/or clinical staff monitoring well beyond that of therapeutic drug agents (96360-96379) because the incidence of severe adverse patient reactions are typically greater. These services can be provided by any physician or other qualified health care professional.” Accordingly, the ACR’s position statement indicates that given the complexity associated with the design, manufacturing, and storage of biologics and differences over time in the structure, efficacy, and safety of biologics, these treatments should be supervised and carried out by specially trained physicians and advanced practitioners who have the required knowledge, training, and experience to administer biologic agents and monitor adverse reactions. The ACR recommends that CPT work with the key stakeholders to change the terminology in the manual from “chemotherapy” to “immunomodulatory” therapies, which is more in line with drug indications.', 'As a reminder, the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) Congress included language allowing the use of the chemotherapy administration code by physicians who administer non-oncologic medications in their offices. The policy also indicated that the same level of supervision was required, and there are no significant differences between earlier biologics and currently proposed biologics in their level of risk in administration. Another key point in the MMA also outlined that these treatments should cost the same to administer, including clinical labor costs, and that no specialty should be reimbursed more than the other. Unfortunately, this has also caused another issue in how “chemotherapy” is assigned with the J-codes versus monoclonal antibody and biologic therapies through HCPCS. There are more than one example of a particular drug used as cancer therapy and an immunomodulator to treat different types of arthritis and vasculitis. To reimburse differently based on specialty is not consistent with the MMA language. Also, the toxicity issues related to these infusions do not differ based on the indication of use.', 'There has been a great deal of progress in the use of biologics in many disciplines, with the expectation for continuous advancement in the future.

The ACR believes the critical components of providing best practice treatments options with biologics and immunomodulatory therapies and protecting the patient and care team relationship are at the highest level of ethical responsibility to our patients and their access to quality healthcare in treating their rheumatologic conditions.\\nCMS plays a crucial role in working with the specialties affected by these policies to identify long- term solutions to the current issues of down coding for services billed for the administration of biologics and the drugs added to the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list. The ACR is concerned that the criteria used for these two policies contradict the proposed nondiscrimination rules created for Medicare Fee-for-Service.\\n\\u201cDowncoding\\u201d The downcoding of complex chemotherapy services has reached a deep concern as it relates to the billing of biologics for the treatment of most non-oncologic conditions. This is mainly due to flawed billing and coding articles created by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that have restricted which complex therapies will be reimbursed using the \\u201cchemotherapy\\u201d administration codes, forcing rheumatologists and other specialists (except for hematology and oncology) to bill these services with the therapeutic drug administration code. The advent and evolution of biologics and other immunomodulating therapies have revolutionized outcomes for patients with auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis, which carry significant morbidity, mortality, and associated healthcare and societal costs. Despite the up-front costs, adding biologics to other treatment modalities has been cost-effective in appropriate patient populations.1\\nThe American Medical Association (AMA) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) states, \\u201cChemotherapy administration codes 96401-96549 apply to parenteral administration of non- radionuclide antineoplastic drugs; and also to anti-neoplastic agents provided for treatment of noncancer diagnoses (e.g., cyclophosphamide for auto-immune conditions) or to substances such as certain monoclonal antibody agents, and other biologic response modifiers.\\u201d Yet, the MACs continue to utilize unsubstantiated criteria to determine which drugs should be defined as complex and warrant the use of complex administration codes.\\nIn 2013, the American College of Rheumatology released its position outlining the common clinical situations that require the use of intravenous biologics as opposed to self-administered biologics and outlined the FDA indications, appropriate use, safety, and off-label use for biologics, which are far more complicated at the molecular level than traditional chemically synthesized drugs.2 Also, based on the evolution of biologics and monoclonal antibody treatments on the market for auto-immune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, dermatology, neurology, and other key areas of medicine, it is appropriate to review the definition of \\u201cchemotherapy,\\u201d which is no longer a useful term, as indications and toxicity should distinguish drugs. The CPT manual also states that \\u201cThe highly complex infusion of chemotherapy or other drug or biologic agents requires a physician or other qualified health care professional work and/or clinical staff monitoring well beyond that of therapeutic drug agents (96360-96379) because the incidence of severe adverse patient reactions are typically greater. These services can be provided by any physician or other qualified health care professional.\\u201d Accordingly, the ACR\\u2019s position statement indicates that given the complexity associated with the design, manufacturing, and storage of biologics and differences over time in the structure, efficacy, and safety of biologics, these treatments should be supervised and carried out by specially trained physicians and advanced practitioners who have the required knowledge, training, and experience to administer biologic agents and monitor adverse reactions. The ACR recommends that CPT work with the key stakeholders to change the terminology in the manual from \\u201cchemotherapy\\u201d to \\u201cimmunomodulatory\\u201d therapies, which is more in line with drug indications.\\nAs a reminder, the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) Congress included language allowing the use of the chemotherapy administration code by physicians who administer non-oncologic medications in their offices. The policy also indicated that the same level of supervision was required, and there are no significant differences between earlier biologics and currently proposed biologics in their level of risk in administration. Another key point in the MMA also outlined that these treatments should cost the same to administer, including clinical labor costs, and that no specialty should be reimbursed more than the other. Unfortunately, this has also caused another issue in how \\u201cchemotherapy\\u201d is assigned with the J-codes versus monoclonal antibody and biologic therapies through HCPCS. There are more than one example of a particular drug used as cancer therapy and an immunomodulator to treat different types of arthritis and vasculitis. To reimburse differently based on specialty is not consistent with the MMA language. Also, the toxicity issues related to these infusions do not differ based on the indication of use.\\nThere has been a great deal of progress in the use of biologics in many disciplines, with the expectation for continuous advancement in the future. The ACR believes that policies related to access and reimbursement for biologic treatment should be transparent and prioritize the well-being and health of patients across disease processes with a focus on reducing morbidity and mortality. We recommend that the agency convene stakeholder roundtables or workgroups to explore regulatory and legislative solutions to these policies to avoid unintended consequences with deleterious impacts on access and coverage for beneficiaries and their healthcare team.\\nSelf-Administered Drug (SAD) List Reimbursement is inadequate for drugs and biologics placed on the existing Self-Administered Drug (SAD) exclusion list policy, and the process used to determine if a drug is usually self-administered by the patient lacks transparency. The ACR is deeply concerned about barriers that limit the ability of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune diseases to obtain affordable, high-quality, high-value healthcare, which includes appropriate treatment. Additionally, beneficiaries who lose access to medication by virtue of inclusion on the SAD list are at risk of delay and deprivation of therapeutic benefits. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and modern treatment approaches have revolutionized outcomes for patients with these diseases. Early aggressive therapy with various drugs, including biologics, has been shown to reduce joint damage and deformities and improve function, reducing work absenteeism, disability, death, costly procedures/surgeries, and hospitalizations.\\nThe ACR affirms the ethical responsibility of the healthcare team to place the welfare of the patient above all other considerations, as well as the importance of safeguarding the patient's relationship with their healthcare team. The ACR\\u2019s goal is to preserve patients\\u2019 access to care from rheumatology specialty care teams and the therapies necessary to treat their rheumatologic conditions. The ACR believes this is an important opportunity for CMS to work with the rheumatology community and other key stakeholders as trusted voices on the critical issue of an equitable approach to the criteria for the SAD list and the billing of the complex administration services, especially as it applies to inadvertent harmful consequences related to poor access to future medications.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summarizer_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Groq_mixtral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) supports CMS's review of biologicals and complex drug administration coding but is concerned about down coding and the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list.

The ACR believes the critical components of providing best practice treatments options with biologics and immunomodulatory therapies and protecting the patient and care team relationship are at the highest level of ethical responsibility to our patients and their access to quality healthcare in treating their rheumatologic conditions.\\nCMS plays a crucial role in working with the specialties affected by these policies to identify long- term solutions to the current issues of down coding for services billed for the administration of biologics and the drugs added to the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list. The ACR is concerned that the criteria used for these two policies contradict the proposed nondiscrimination rules created for Medicare Fee-for-Service.\\n\\u201cDowncoding\\u201d The downcoding of complex chemotherapy services has reached a deep concern as it relates to the billing of biologics for the treatment of most non-oncologic conditions. This is mainly due to flawed billing and coding articles created by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that have restricted which complex therapies will be reimbursed using the \\u201cchemotherapy\\u201d administration codes, forcing rheumatologists and other specialists (except for hematology and oncology) to bill these services with the therapeutic drug administration code. The advent and evolution of biologics and other immunomodulating therapies have revolutionized outcomes for patients with auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis, which carry significant morbidity, mortality, and associated healthcare and societal costs. Despite the up-front costs, adding biologics to other treatment modalities has been cost-effective in appropriate patient populations.1\\nThe American Medical Association (AMA) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) states, \\u201cChemotherapy administration codes 96401-96549 apply to parenteral administration of non- radionuclide antineoplastic drugs; and also to anti-neoplastic agents provided for treatment of noncancer diagnoses (e.g., cyclophosphamide for auto-immune conditions) or to substances such as certain monoclonal antibody agents, and other biologic response modifiers.\\u201d Yet, the MACs continue to utilize unsubstantiated criteria to determine which drugs should be defined as complex and warrant the use of complex administration codes.\\nIn 2013, the American College of Rheumatology released its position outlining the common clinical situations that require the use of intravenous biologics as opposed to self-administered biologics and outlined the FDA indications, appropriate use, safety, and off-label use for biologics, which are far more complicated at the molecular level than traditional chemically synthesized drugs.2 Also, based on the evolution of biologics and monoclonal antibody treatments on the market for auto-immune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, dermatology, neurology, and other key areas of medicine, it is appropriate to review the definition of \\u201cchemotherapy,\\u201d which is no longer a useful term, as indications and toxicity should distinguish drugs. The CPT manual also states that \\u201cThe highly complex infusion of chemotherapy or other drug or biologic agents requires a physician or other qualified health care professional work and/or clinical staff monitoring well beyond that of therapeutic drug agents (96360-96379) because the incidence of severe adverse patient reactions are typically greater. These services can be provided by any physician or other qualified health care professional.\\u201d Accordingly, the ACR\\u2019s position statement indicates that given the complexity associated with the design, manufacturing, and storage of biologics and differences over time in the structure, efficacy, and safety of biologics, these treatments should be supervised and carried out by specially trained physicians and advanced practitioners who have the required knowledge, training, and experience to administer biologic agents and monitor adverse reactions. The ACR recommends that CPT work with the key stakeholders to change the terminology in the manual from \\u201cchemotherapy\\u201d to \\u201cimmunomodulatory\\u201d therapies, which is more in line with drug indications.\\nAs a reminder, the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) Congress included language allowing the use of the chemotherapy administration code by physicians who administer non-oncologic medications in their offices. The policy also indicated that the same level of supervision was required, and there are no significant differences between earlier biologics and currently proposed biologics in their level of risk in administration. Another key point in the MMA also outlined that these treatments should cost the same to administer, including clinical labor costs, and that no specialty should be reimbursed more than the other. Unfortunately, this has also caused another issue in how \\u201cchemotherapy\\u201d is assigned with the J-codes versus monoclonal antibody and biologic therapies through HCPCS. There are more than one example of a particular drug used as cancer therapy and an immunomodulator to treat different types of arthritis and vasculitis. To reimburse differently based on specialty is not consistent with the MMA language. Also, the toxicity issues related to these infusions do not differ based on the indication of use.\\nThere has been a great deal of progress in the use of biologics in many disciplines, with the expectation for continuous advancement in the future. The ACR believes that policies related to access and reimbursement for biologic treatment should be transparent and prioritize the well-being and health of patients across disease processes with a focus on reducing morbidity and mortality. We recommend that the agency convene stakeholder roundtables or workgroups to explore regulatory and legislative solutions to these policies to avoid unintended consequences with deleterious impacts on access and coverage for beneficiaries and their healthcare team.\\nSelf-Administered Drug (SAD) List Reimbursement is inadequate for drugs and biologics placed on the existing Self-Administered Drug (SAD) exclusion list policy, and the process used to determine if a drug is usually self-administered by the patient lacks transparency. The ACR is deeply concerned about barriers that limit the ability of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune diseases to obtain affordable, high-quality, high-value healthcare, which includes appropriate treatment. Additionally, beneficiaries who lose access to medication by virtue of inclusion on the SAD list are at risk of delay and deprivation of therapeutic benefits. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and modern treatment approaches have revolutionized outcomes for patients with these diseases. Early aggressive therapy with various drugs, including biologics, has been shown to reduce joint damage and deformities and improve function, reducing work absenteeism, disability, death, costly procedures/surgeries, and hospitalizations.\\nThe ACR affirms the ethical responsibility of the healthcare team to place the welfare of the patient above all other considerations, as well as the importance of safeguarding the patient's relationship with their healthcare team. The ACR\\u2019s goal is to preserve patients\\u2019 access to care from rheumatology specialty care teams and the therapies necessary to treat their rheumatologic conditions. The ACR believes this is an important opportunity for CMS to work with the rheumatology community and other key stakeholders as trusted voices on the critical issue of an equitable approach to the criteria for the SAD list and the billing of the complex administration services, especially as it applies to inadvertent harmful consequences related to poor access to future medications.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summarizer_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Gpt4\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) expresses concern over CMS's policies on the administration of biologics and complex drug coding, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive review to address the challenges faced by rheumatologists and other specialists.

The ACR believes the critical components of providing best practice treatments options with biologics and immunomodulatory therapies and protecting the patient and care team relationship are at the highest level of ethical responsibility to our patients and their access to quality healthcare in treating their rheumatologic conditions.\\nCMS plays a crucial role in working with the specialties affected by these policies to identify long- term solutions to the current issues of down coding for services billed for the administration of biologics and the drugs added to the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list. The ACR is concerned that the criteria used for these two policies contradict the proposed nondiscrimination rules created for Medicare Fee-for-Service.\\n\\u201cDowncoding\\u201d The downcoding of complex chemotherapy services has reached a deep concern as it relates to the billing of biologics for the treatment of most non-oncologic conditions. This is mainly due to flawed billing and coding articles created by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that have restricted which complex therapies will be reimbursed using the \\u201cchemotherapy\\u201d administration codes, forcing rheumatologists and other specialists (except for hematology and oncology) to bill these services with the therapeutic drug administration code. The advent and evolution of biologics and other immunomodulating therapies have revolutionized outcomes for patients with auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis, which carry significant morbidity, mortality, and associated healthcare and societal costs. Despite the up-front costs, adding biologics to other treatment modalities has been cost-effective in appropriate patient populations.1\\nThe American Medical Association (AMA) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) states, \\u201cChemotherapy administration codes 96401-96549 apply to parenteral administration of non- radionuclide antineoplastic drugs; and also to anti-neoplastic agents provided for treatment of noncancer diagnoses (e.g., cyclophosphamide for auto-immune conditions) or to substances such as certain monoclonal antibody agents, and other biologic response modifiers.\\u201d Yet, the MACs continue to utilize unsubstantiated criteria to determine which drugs should be defined as complex and warrant the use of complex administration codes.\\nIn 2013, the American College of Rheumatology released its position outlining the common clinical situations that require the use of intravenous biologics as opposed to self-administered biologics and outlined the FDA indications, appropriate use, safety, and off-label use for biologics, which are far more complicated at the molecular level than traditional chemically synthesized drugs.2 Also, based on the evolution of biologics and monoclonal antibody treatments on the market for auto-immune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, dermatology, neurology, and other key areas of medicine, it is appropriate to review the definition of \\u201cchemotherapy,\\u201d which is no longer a useful term, as indications and toxicity should distinguish drugs. The CPT manual also states that \\u201cThe highly complex infusion of chemotherapy or other drug or biologic agents requires a physician or other qualified health care professional work and/or clinical staff monitoring well beyond that of therapeutic drug agents (96360-96379) because the incidence of severe adverse patient reactions are typically greater. These services can be provided by any physician or other qualified health care professional.\\u201d Accordingly, the ACR\\u2019s position statement indicates that given the complexity associated with the design, manufacturing, and storage of biologics and differences over time in the structure, efficacy, and safety of biologics, these treatments should be supervised and carried out by specially trained physicians and advanced practitioners who have the required knowledge, training, and experience to administer biologic agents and monitor adverse reactions. The ACR recommends that CPT work with the key stakeholders to change the terminology in the manual from \\u201cchemotherapy\\u201d to \\u201cimmunomodulatory\\u201d therapies, which is more in line with drug indications.\\nAs a reminder, the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) Congress included language allowing the use of the chemotherapy administration code by physicians who administer non-oncologic medications in their offices. The policy also indicated that the same level of supervision was required, and there are no significant differences between earlier biologics and currently proposed biologics in their level of risk in administration. Another key point in the MMA also outlined that these treatments should cost the same to administer, including clinical labor costs, and that no specialty should be reimbursed more than the other. Unfortunately, this has also caused another issue in how \\u201cchemotherapy\\u201d is assigned with the J-codes versus monoclonal antibody and biologic therapies through HCPCS. There are more than one example of a particular drug used as cancer therapy and an immunomodulator to treat different types of arthritis and vasculitis. To reimburse differently based on specialty is not consistent with the MMA language. Also, the toxicity issues related to these infusions do not differ based on the indication of use.\\nThere has been a great deal of progress in the use of biologics in many disciplines, with the expectation for continuous advancement in the future. The ACR believes that policies related to access and reimbursement for biologic treatment should be transparent and prioritize the well-being and health of patients across disease processes with a focus on reducing morbidity and mortality. We recommend that the agency convene stakeholder roundtables or workgroups to explore regulatory and legislative solutions to these policies to avoid unintended consequences with deleterious impacts on access and coverage for beneficiaries and their healthcare team.\\nSelf-Administered Drug (SAD) List Reimbursement is inadequate for drugs and biologics placed on the existing Self-Administered Drug (SAD) exclusion list policy, and the process used to determine if a drug is usually self-administered by the patient lacks transparency. The ACR is deeply concerned about barriers that limit the ability of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune diseases to obtain affordable, high-quality, high-value healthcare, which includes appropriate treatment. Additionally, beneficiaries who lose access to medication by virtue of inclusion on the SAD list are at risk of delay and deprivation of therapeutic benefits. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and modern treatment approaches have revolutionized outcomes for patients with these diseases. Early aggressive therapy with various drugs, including biologics, has been shown to reduce joint damage and deformities and improve function, reducing work absenteeism, disability, death, costly procedures/surgeries, and hospitalizations.\\nThe ACR affirms the ethical responsibility of the healthcare team to place the welfare of the patient above all other considerations, as well as the importance of safeguarding the patient's relationship with their healthcare team. The ACR\\u2019s goal is to preserve patients\\u2019 access to care from rheumatology specialty care teams and the therapies necessary to treat their rheumatologic conditions. The ACR believes this is an important opportunity for CMS to work with the rheumatology community and other key stakeholders as trusted voices on the critical issue of an equitable approach to the criteria for the SAD list and the billing of the complex administration services, especially as it applies to inadvertent harmful consequences related to poor access to future medications.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summarizer_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Gpt4\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) supports CMS's review of drug administration coding and the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list, emphasizing the ethical responsibility to provide best practice treatments for rheumatologic conditions.

        "4. Use the Groq API: Once the Groq script is deployed as an API, you can use it in your business application by sending HTTP requests to the API endpoints. You can use a programming language like Python or a framework like Flask to build the API client.\n",
        "5. Scale the Groq API: To scale the Groq API, you can use a distributed computing framework like Apache Spark or Apache Flink. These frameworks can distribute the data processing tasks across multiple nodes, allowing you to process large volumes of data efficiently.\n",
        "6. Monitor and optimize: Monitor the performance of the Groq API and optimize it as needed. You can use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the API performance, and use optimization techniques like caching, parallelization, and data compression to improve the performance.\n",

The ACR believes the critical components of providing best practice treatments options with biologics and immunomodulatory therapies and protecting the patient and care team relationship are at the highest level of ethical responsibility to our patients and their access to quality healthcare in treating their rheumatologic conditions.\\nCMS plays a crucial role in working with the specialties affected by these policies to identify long- term solutions to the current issues of down coding for services billed for the administration of biologics and the drugs added to the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list. The ACR is concerned that the criteria used for these two policies contradict the proposed nondiscrimination rules created for Medicare Fee-for-Service.\\n\\u201cDowncoding\\u201d The downcoding of complex chemotherapy services has reached a deep concern as it relates to the billing of biologics for the treatment of most non-oncologic conditions. This is mainly due to flawed billing and coding articles created by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that have restricted which complex therapies will be reimbursed using the \\u201cchemotherapy\\u201d administration codes, forcing rheumatologists and other specialists (except for hematology and oncology) to bill these services with the therapeutic drug administration code. The advent and evolution of biologics and other immunomodulating therapies have revolutionized outcomes for patients with auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis, which carry significant morbidity, mortality, and associated healthcare and societal costs. Despite the up-front costs, adding biologics to other treatment modalities has been cost-effective in appropriate patient populations.1\\nThe American Medical Association (AMA) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) states, \\u201cChemotherapy administration codes 96401-96549 apply to parenteral administration of non- radionuclide antineoplastic drugs; and also to anti-neoplastic agents provided for treatment of noncancer diagnoses (e.g., cyclophosphamide for auto-immune conditions) or to substances such as certain monoclonal antibody agents, and other biologic response modifiers.\\u201d Yet, the MACs continue to utilize unsubstantiated criteria to determine which drugs should be defined as complex and warrant the use of complex administration codes.\\nIn 2013, the American College of Rheumatology released its position outlining the common clinical situations that require the use of intravenous biologics as opposed to self-administered biologics and outlined the FDA indications, appropriate use, safety, and off-label use for biologics, which are far more complicated at the molecular level than traditional chemically synthesized drugs.2 Also, based on the evolution of biologics and monoclonal antibody treatments on the market for auto-immune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, dermatology, neurology, and other key areas of medicine, it is appropriate to review the definition of \\u201cchemotherapy,\\u201d which is no longer a useful term, as indications and toxicity should distinguish drugs. The CPT manual also states that \\u201cThe highly complex infusion of chemotherapy or other drug or biologic agents requires a physician or other qualified health care professional work and/or clinical staff monitoring well beyond that of therapeutic drug agents (96360-96379) because the incidence of severe adverse patient reactions are typically greater. These services can be provided by any physician or other qualified health care professional.\\u201d Accordingly, the ACR\\u2019s position statement indicates that given the complexity associated with the design, manufacturing, and storage of biologics and differences over time in the structure, efficacy, and safety of biologics, these treatments should be supervised and carried out by specially trained physicians and advanced practitioners who have the required knowledge, training, and experience to administer biologic agents and monitor adverse reactions. The ACR recommends that CPT work with the key stakeholders to change the terminology in the manual from \\u201cchemotherapy\\u201d to \\u201cimmunomodulatory\\u201d therapies, which is more in line with drug indications.\\nAs a reminder, the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) Congress included language allowing the use of the chemotherapy administration code by physicians who administer non-oncologic medications in their offices. The policy also indicated that the same level of supervision was required, and there are no significant differences between earlier biologics and currently proposed biologics in their level of risk in administration. Another key point in the MMA also outlined that these treatments should cost the same to administer, including clinical labor costs, and that no specialty should be reimbursed more than the other. Unfortunately, this has also caused another issue in how \\u201cchemotherapy\\u201d is assigned with the J-codes versus monoclonal antibody and biologic therapies through HCPCS. There are more than one example of a particular drug used as cancer therapy and an immunomodulator to treat different types of arthritis and vasculitis. To reimburse differently based on specialty is not consistent with the MMA language. Also, the toxicity issues related to these infusions do not differ based on the indication of use.\\nThere has been a great deal of progress in the use of biologics in many disciplines, with the expectation for continuous advancement in the future. The ACR believes that policies related to access and reimbursement for biologic treatment should be transparent and prioritize the well-being and health of patients across disease processes with a focus on reducing morbidity and mortality. We recommend that the agency convene stakeholder roundtables or workgroups to explore regulatory and legislative solutions to these policies to avoid unintended consequences with deleterious impacts on access and coverage for beneficiaries and their healthcare team.\\nSelf-Administered Drug (SAD) List Reimbursement is inadequate for drugs and biologics placed on the existing Self-Administered Drug (SAD) exclusion list policy, and the process used to determine if a drug is usually self-administered by the patient lacks transparency. The ACR is deeply concerned about barriers that limit the ability of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune diseases to obtain affordable, high-quality, high-value healthcare, which includes appropriate treatment. Additionally, beneficiaries who lose access to medication by virtue of inclusion on the SAD list are at risk of delay and deprivation of therapeutic benefits. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and modern treatment approaches have revolutionized outcomes for patients with these diseases. Early aggressive therapy with various drugs, including biologics, has been shown to reduce joint damage and deformities and improve function, reducing work absenteeism, disability, death, costly procedures/surgeries, and hospitalizations.\\nThe ACR affirms the ethical responsibility of the healthcare team to place the welfare of the patient above all other considerations, as well as the importance of safeguarding the patient's relationship with their healthcare team. The ACR\\u2019s goal is to preserve patients\\u2019 access to care from rheumatology specialty care teams and the therapies necessary to treat their rheumatologic conditions. The ACR believes this is an important opportunity for CMS to work with the rheumatology community and other key stakeholders as trusted voices on the critical issue of an equitable approach to the criteria for the SAD list and the billing of the complex administration services, especially as it applies to inadvertent harmful consequences related to poor access to future medications.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The ACR believes the critical components of providing best practice treatments options with biologics and immunomodulatory therapies and protecting the patient and care team relationship are at the highest level of ethical responsibility to our patients and their access to quality healthcare in treating their rheumatologic conditions.', 'CMS plays a crucial role in working with the specialties affected by these policies to identify long- term solutions to the current issues of down coding for services billed for the administration of biologics and the drugs added to the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list. The ACR is concerned that the criteria used for these two policies contradict the proposed nondiscrimination rules created for Medicare Fee-for-Service.', '“Downcoding” The downcoding of complex chemotherapy services has reached a deep concern as it relates to the billing of biologics for the treatment of most non-oncologic conditions. This is mainly due to flawed billing and coding articles created by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that have restricted which complex therapies will be reimbursed using the “chemotherapy” administration codes, forcing rheumatologists and other specialists (except for hematology and oncology) to bill these services with the therapeutic drug administration code. The advent and evolution of biologics and other immunomodulating therapies have revolutionized outcomes for patients with auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis, which carry significant morbidity, mortality, and associated healthcare and societal costs. Despite the up-front costs, adding biologics to other treatment modalities has been cost-effective in appropriate patient populations.1', 'The American Medical Association (AMA) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) states, “Chemotherapy administration codes 96401-96549 apply to parenteral administration of non- radionuclide antineoplastic drugs; and also to anti-neoplastic agents provided for treatment of noncancer diagnoses (e.g., cyclophosphamide for auto-immune conditions) or to substances such as certain monoclonal antibody agents, and other biologic response modifiers.” Yet, the MACs continue to utilize unsubstantiated criteria to determine which drugs should be defined as complex and warrant the use of complex administration codes.', 'In 2013, the American College of Rheumatology released its position outlining the common clinical situations that require the use of intravenous biologics as opposed to self-administered biologics and outlined the FDA indications, appropriate use, safety, and off-label use for biologics, which are far more complicated at the molecular level than traditional chemically synthesized drugs.2 Also, based on the evolution of biologics and monoclonal antibody treatments on the market for auto-immune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, dermatology, neurology, and other key areas of medicine, it is appropriate to review the definition of “chemotherapy,” which is no longer a useful term, as indications and toxicity should distinguish drugs. The CPT manual also states that “The highly complex infusion of chemotherapy or other drug or biologic agents requires a physician or other qualified health care professional work and/or clinical staff monitoring well beyond that of therapeutic drug agents (96360-96379) because the incidence of severe adverse patient reactions are typically greater. These services can be provided by any physician or other qualified health care professional.” Accordingly, the ACR’s position statement indicates that given the complexity associated with the design, manufacturing, and storage of biologics and differences over time in the structure, efficacy, and safety of biologics, these treatments should be supervised and carried out by specially trained physicians and advanced practitioners who have the required knowledge, training, and experience to administer biologic agents and monitor adverse reactions. The ACR recommends that CPT work with the key stakeholders to change the terminology in the manual from “chemotherapy” to “immunomodulatory” therapies, which is more in line with drug indications.', 'As a reminder, the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) Congress included language allowing the use of the chemotherapy administration code by physicians who administer non-oncologic medications in their offices. The policy also indicated that the same level of supervision was required, and there are no significant differences between earlier biologics and currently proposed biologics in their level of risk in administration. Another key point in the MMA also outlined that these treatments should cost the same to administer, including clinical labor costs, and that no specialty should be reimbursed more than the other. Unfortunately, this has also caused another issue in how “chemotherapy” is assigned with the J-codes versus monoclonal antibody and biologic therapies through HCPCS. There are more than one example of a particular drug used as cancer therapy and an immunomodulator to treat different types of arthritis and vasculitis. To reimburse differently based on specialty is not consistent with the MMA language. Also, the toxicity issues related to these infusions do not differ based on the indication of use.', 'There has been a great deal of progress in the use of biologics in many disciplines, with the expectation for continuous advancement in the future. The ACR believes that policies related to access and reimbursement for biologic treatment should be transparent and prioritize the well-being and health of patients across disease processes with a focus on reducing morbidity and mortality. We recommend that the agency convene stakeholder roundtables or workgroups to explore regulatory and legislative solutions to these policies to avoid unintended consequences with deleterious impacts on access and coverage for beneficiaries and their healthcare team.', 'Self-Administered Drug (SAD) List Reimbursement is inadequate for drugs and biologics placed on the existing Self-Administered Drug (SAD) exclusion list policy, and the process used to determine if a drug is usually self-administered by the patient lacks transparency. The ACR is deeply concerned about barriers that limit the ability of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune diseases to obtain affordable, high-quality, high-value healthcare, which includes appropriate treatment. Additionally, beneficiaries who lose access to medication by virtue of inclusion on the SAD list are at risk of delay and deprivation of therapeutic benefits. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and modern treatment approaches have revolutionized outcomes for patients with these diseases. Early aggressive therapy with various drugs, including biologics, has been shown to reduce joint damage and deformities and improve function, reducing work absenteeism, disability, death, costly procedures/surgeries, and hospitalizations.', \"The ACR affirms the ethical responsibility of the healthcare team to place the welfare of the patient above all other considerations, as well as the importance of safeguarding the patient's relationship with their healthcare team. The ACR’s goal is to preserve patients’ access to care from rheumatology specialty care teams and the therapies necessary to treat their rheumatologic conditions. The ACR believes this is an important opportunity for CMS to work with the rheumatology community and other key stakeholders as trusted voices on the critical issue of an equitable approach to the criteria for the SAD list and the billing of the complex administration services, especially as it applies to inadvertent harmful consequences related to poor access to future medications.\"]\n",

        "Using the Gemma ready-to-use Colab notebooks for text summarization is a great way to get started with Gemma's capabilities without any local setup. Here's how:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Accessing the Notebook:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Search for \"Gemma Colab notebooks\" in your web browser. This should lead you to the relevant Google Colab search results.\n",
        "* Alternatively, you can visit the official Gemma GitHub repository and navigate to the \"examples\" folder. Within this folder, you'll find Colab notebooks for various tasks, including text summarization. [https://github.com/google-deepmind/gemma](https://github.com/google-deepmind/gemma)\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Opening the Notebook:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Once you locate the desired notebook (e.g., \"text_summarization.ipynb\"), click on it to open it in Colab. This will launch a new Colab environment pre-configured with the necessary libraries and Gemma models.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Running the Notebook:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Carefully review the code cells within the notebook. These cells typically explain the steps involved in the text summarization process and demonstrate how to use Gemma for this task.\n",
        "* You can run each code cell individually by clicking the \"Run\" button (play icon) next to the cell. Alternatively, you can run the entire notebook by clicking \"Runtime\" -> \"Run all\" from the Colab menu.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Providing Input Text:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The notebook might have designated sections where you can provide your input text for summarization. This could be a text string directly inserted into a code cell or uploading a text file.\n",
        "* Follow the instructions within the notebook for providing your input.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Generating Summary:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Once you've provided the input text and run the relevant code cells, the notebook will utilize Gemma to generate a summary of the text. This summary will be displayed within the notebook's output cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Additional Tips:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The Colab notebooks often come with comments and explanations within the code cells. These can be helpful in understanding the process and modifying the code for different use cases.\n",

        "#text=\"Continuation   of   Non-Facility   Payment  Rate CMS proposes that telehealth services provided to patients in their homes should be reported with place   of service (POS) code 10, which was established in the 2022 final rule. CMS established policy in the 2023 final rule that,   for calendar year 2023,   Medicare would continue paying for telehealth   services at the non-facility payment rate instead of returning to its pre-PHE policy of paying for these services at the reduced facility payment rates that apply to services provided in hospital settings. (Although the facility rates are lower than the non-facility rates, for services provided in hospitals and other facility settings, Medicare   makes   a   separate   payment   to   the   facility   in   addition   to   the   payment for the   physician   service.) In the current rule, CMS proposes to align with the telehealth-related flexibilities that were extended via the CAA, 2023, by continuing to pay for telehealth services provided to patients in their homes at the non- facility payment rate for 2024 when the services are reported with POS 10. The AMA appreciates CMS’s recognition that physicians who provide both in-person office services and telehealth services need to receive sufficient compensation to cover the expense of maintaining their medical office.\"\n",

Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. We start by loading the necessary packages: DataFrames for working with tabular data, CSV for reading CSV files, Statistics for statistical functions, and Plots for creating visualizations.\n\n2. We load the dataset from a CSV file using `CSV.read()` and store it in a DataFrame called `data`.\n\n3. We explore the dataset by printing its size, column names, data types, and summary statistics using functions like `size()`, `names()`, `eltype()`, and `describe()`.\n\n4. We perform data cleaning and preprocessing steps, such as removing missing values using `dropmissing()` and converting a column to numeric type using `parse()`.\n\n5. We compute basic statistics, such as the mean age and median salary, using functions from the Statistics package.\n\n6. We group the data by a categorical variable and calculate the average value using `groupby()` and `combine()`.\n\n7. We create visualizations using the Plots package. In this example, we create a scatter plot and a bar plot using `scatter()` and `bar()` functions, respectively.\n\n8. Finally, we save the plots as image files using `savefig()`.\n\nNote: Make sure to have the required packages installed before running the code. You can install them using the Julia package manager, for example: `using Pkg; Pkg.add([\"DataFrames\", \"CSV\", \"Statistics\", \"Plots\"])`.\n\nThis code provides a starting point for a simple data analysis in Julia. You can customize and extend it based on your specific dataset and analysis requirements."
